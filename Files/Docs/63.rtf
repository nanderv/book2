\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Daniel is split between wanting to figure out what\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s going on in the world, and wanting to live a normal life. He wants to start a family with his girlfriend, he wants to just focus on his work. After he pulls at a thread, he can\u8217\'92t stop pulling, thinking the rope will stop at some point. Instead, it seems to unroll all the way. \line While he does this, his relationships with everyone and everything deteriorates, especially the one with his wife.\line In the end, he decides to tell her, and she tells the government that he has gone insane. They had a two-year-old child by this point, and she was terrified of her child being hurt because of his stupidity. And since he betrayed her anyway, she felt this was justified.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \line Second part of story (if first one doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t get there): either his child, or someone else, and told as the story of someone who sees the world fall apart. Mimics the first arc to a certain extent, but on a bigger scale.}}
