\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Whatever Daniel had expected to get in return for the bombs that exploded, the initial result wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t what he had hoped. It was mostly people scraping by for survival. The initial few days had been all about trying to find people that were still alive, and finding more resources for immediate survival. After that, there was a little stockpile of food, and some basic necessities, such as some bandages, basic medicines, etc. It would be enough for a couple of weeks, given the current population. This meant that, quite soon, farming would have to start. Since some potatoes were found, they were put into the ground almost immediately. The park was turned into farming land, bit by bit. With a current population of around thirty-five, the park would, if producing at full capacity, be just about enough for the food for everyone. However, it would not be possible to start up full-scale production directly. There weren\u8217\'92t enough potatoes around to put into the ground. It was decided not to waste any of them by eating them, arguing that they would be more useful if multiplied. If hunger was going to happen, might as well have it happen earlier in the cycle, such was the idea. Also, they were thinking that new food might still be found in the early times after the explosion. Besides farming, half of the remaining population was put on scavenging, with the rest put on repairs. The idea was to have at least some nice housing done. It was the warmer period of the year. The cold-period would not be extremely cold, but having somewhat insulated homes would go a long way towards preventing people from getting sick. It would also mean people would have to eat less, since they could keep themselves warm.\line The scavenging groups were doing a great job. Their basic task was to go through houses and find food and other useful items. They were also tasked with trying to find other people that survived. Mostly though, they came across dead people. The shard still had one connecting bridge still standing, which connected it to another Shard. That shard was in an a lot less great shape. Most buildings had collapsed, the debris blocking some of the roads on there. For the first few days, there had still been fires there, but they had run out of things to burn, so now they went cold. Slowly, but certainly, the survivors were expanding their territory. They were hoping to find canned food, or other food that could have survived the fires. It turned out that tin cans in cellars were actually quite often still okay, to the surprise of many. Fires apparently didn\u8217\'92t really go down into the cellar that often, flames mostly go up.\line Over the next few weeks, scavenging results were dropping day-by-day. The teams needed to head out further and further away, because the parts nearby had already been scavenged. This meant the territory got more inhospitable, as well as the walk itself becoming longer and longer. And, since the path wasn\u8217\'92t easy to clear, most of it was kept in a state full of random stuff.\line \line When the winter came, they had enough food. It was cold, dreadful, and generally not a nice period, but they were able to get through it. The new reality became increasingly livable. Plus, with this small group, decisions were actually made by involving everyone. There were no secrets, not anymore. Everyone was involved with everything, had a say in everything, and was happy like this. As the food supplies increased, so did everyone\u8217\'92s happiness. The old addage that food is the first important thing to give people still holds, especially after a major disaster. Daniel sat down on one of the benches, and relaxed. He felt like things were moving forward. The price had been terribly high, but it looked like, now at least, there was improvement. There was no inequality anymore; everyone just worked to their best ability, and took what they needed. Greed seemed to have made way for kindness and a mentality of sharing. Daniel wondered though if there had been other groups of people that had survived the explosion, and how they would be doing. He hoped the same thing that had happened here happened in other places as well. \line A few weeks later, they figured out that it hadn\u8217\'92t. During one of their scavenging trips, they saw a small group of people in the distance. They proceeded with caution, seeing that they were armed. Staying hidden, Daniel and the rest of this group had a view over the situation. Three guys armed with crowbars walked towards a person who was partially hidden. The person screamed, as she was pushed on the ground. They said something to her. When she said no, they bashed her head in with the crowbar. Daniel and the others decided they had seen enough, and slowly retreated. They would have to decide together with the rest how to deal with this situation. They hadn\u8217\'92t really considered what to do if they met people who didn\u8217\'92t hold the same values as themselves. Daniel guessed though that the only options would then be to either ignore them, or actively fight them. He hoped his group was the only group that had found weapons so far, but wasn\u8217\'92t sure. Most of the weapons were stored in facilities quite near the site of the explosion, so they were cut off from the rest of the Capital now; the bridges connecting that area had all been destroyed. It would only take one fool with a gun to kill one of the thirty-five people here. They hadn\u8217\'92t had to bury anyone since the event, and weren\u8217\'92t planning to have to do so any time soon. A military conflict was therefore not something they could really afford to do. Life simply was too valuable now, especially the lives of the people where; the ones believing in progress. \line When they returned, a meeting was scheduled for that evening. Everyone was to be present, because this was information that was important for everyone. That evening, everyone was waiting to figure out what they had been summoned for. They had decided to wait with the message until the meeting, so everyone would know at the same time. Well, the people on the mission would know before that, of course, but there was no way to stop that. Daniel took the word: \u8220\'93Hi all, you may wonder why this meeting was summoned. As you may know, we were on a mission to scavenge for food. However, we ran into other survivors. After looking at what they were doing, we saw that they had not chosen the same path that we had, instead choosing for violence and individualism. We witnissed someone get brutally murdered, because she wouldn\u8217\'92t give them what they asked for. So, we either have to fight there, or can\u8217\'92t really progress in that direction. I would like to hear your opinions on this. I wouldn\u8217\'92t make a decision on it tonight though, because this is too important to come to a rushed conclusion.\u8221\'94.}}
