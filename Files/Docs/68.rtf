\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Whatever Daniel had expected to get in return for the bombs that exploded, the initial result wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t what he had hoped. It was mostly people scraping by for survival. The initial few days had been all about trying to find people that were still alive, and finding more resources for immediate survival. After that, there was a little stockpile of food, and some basic necessities, such as some bandages, basic medicines, etc. It would be enough for a couple of weeks, given the current population. This meant that, quite soon, farming would have to start. Since some potatoes were found, they were put into the ground almost immediately. The park was turned into farming land, bit by bit. With a current population of around thirty-five, the park would, if producing at full capacity, be just about enough for the food for everyone. However, it would not be possible to start up full-scale production directly. There weren\u8217\'92t enough potatoes around to put into the ground. It was decided not to waste any of them by eating them, arguing that they would be more useful if multiplied. If hunger was going to happen, might as well have it happen earlier in the cycle, such was the idea. Also, they were thinking that new food might still be found in the early times after the explosion. Besides farming, half of the remaining population was put on scavenging, with the rest put on repairs. The idea was to have at least some nice housing done. It was the warmer period of the year. The cold-period would not be extremely cold, but having somewhat insulated homes would go a long way towards preventing people from getting sick. It would also mean people would have to eat less, since they could keep themselves warm.\line The scavenging groups were doing a great job. Their basic task was to go through houses and find food and other useful items. They were also tasked with trying to find other people that survived. Mostly though, they came across dead people. The shard still had one connecting bridge still standing, which connected it to another Shard. That shard was in an a lot less great shape. Most buildings had collapsed, the debris blocking some of the roads on there. For the first few days, there had still been fires there, but they had run out of things to burn, so now they went cold. Slowly, but certainly, the survivors were expanding their territory. They were hoping to find canned food, or other food that could have survived the fires. It turned out that tin cans in cellars were actually quite often still okay, to the surprise of many. Fires apparently didn\u8217\'92t really go down into the cellar that often, flames mostly go up.\line Over the next few weeks, scavenging results were dropping day-by-day. The teams needed to head out further and further away, because the parts nearby had already been scavenged. This meant the territory got more inhospitable, as well as the walk itself becoming longer and longer. And, since the path wasn\u8217\'92t easy to clear, most of it was kept in a state full of random stuff.\line \line When the winter came, they had enough food. It was cold, dreadful, and generally not a nice period, but they were able to get through it. The new reality became increasingly livable. Plus, with this small group, decisions were actually made by involving everyone. There were no secrets, not anymore. Everyone was involved with everything, had a say in everything, and was happy like this. As the food supplies increased, so did everyone\u8217\'92s happiness. The old adage that food is the first important thing to give people still holds, especially after a major disaster. Daniel sat down on one of the benches, and relaxed. He felt like things were moving forward. The price had been terribly high, but it looked like, now at least, there was improvement. There was no inequality anymore; everyone just worked to their best ability, and took what they needed. Greed seemed to have made way for kindness and a mentality of sharing. Daniel wondered though if there had been other groups of people that had survived the explosion, and how they would be doing. He hoped the same thing that had happened here happened in other places as well. \line A few weeks later, they figured out that it hadn\u8217\'92t. During one of their scavenging trips, they saw a small group of people in the distance. They proceeded with caution, seeing that they were armed. Staying hidden, Daniel and the rest of this group had a view over the situation. Three guys armed with crowbars walked towards a person who was partially hidden. The person screamed, as she was pushed on the ground. They said something to her. When she said no, they bashed her head in with the crowbar. Daniel and the others decided they had seen enough, and slowly retreated. They would have to decide together with the rest how to deal with this situation. They hadn\u8217\'92t really considered what to do if they met people who didn\u8217\'92t hold the same values as themselves. Daniel guessed though that the only options would then be to either ignore them, or actively fight them. He hoped his group was the only group that had found weapons so far, but wasn\u8217\'92t sure. Most of the weapons were stored in facilities quite near the site of the explosion, so they were cut off from the rest of the Capital now; the bridges connecting that area had all been destroyed. It would only take one fool with a gun to kill one of the thirty-five people here. They hadn\u8217\'92t had to bury anyone since the event, and weren\u8217\'92t planning to have to do so any time soon. A military conflict was therefore not something they could really afford to do. Life simply was too valuable now, especially the lives of the people where; the ones believing in progress. \line When they returned, a meeting was scheduled for that evening. Everyone was to be present, because this was information that was important for everyone. That evening, everyone was waiting to figure out what they had been summoned for. They had decided to wait with the message until the meeting, so everyone would know at the same time. Well, the people on the mission would know before that, of course, but there was no way to stop that. Daniel took the word: \u8220\'93Hi all, you may wonder why this meeting was summoned. As you may know, we were on a mission to scavenge for food. However, we ran into other survivors. After looking at what they were doing, we saw that they had not chosen the same path that we had, instead choosing for violence and individualism. We witnessed someone get brutally murdered, because she wouldn\u8217\'92t give them what they asked for. So, we either have to fight there, or can\u8217\'92t really progress in that direction. I would like to hear your opinions on this. I wouldn\u8217\'92t make a decision on it tonight though, because this is too important to come to a rushed conclusion.\u8221\'94. #Hank, one of the other survivors was looking thoughtfully. He had been an engineer before the explosion. He was working on fixing the plumbing of a house when the explosion happened. It had caused the building to come down, trapping one of his legs underneath the rubble. He had survived, but the leg broke, and during the healing it had become a few centimetres longer than the other leg. This gave him a bit of a limb. Other than that, he was physically perfectly in order. He was a thoughtful person, always trying to figure out what option would be the best for everyone. He scratched his voice, and said: \u8220\'93We should consider the people living in that world. I would guess that a lot of them don\u8217\'92t }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 want}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  to live like that. They would much rather live in a society that supports them. So, for as far as we can, we should try to support some of them.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94. Julia, a former \u8230\'85, answered: \u8220\'93But, we have to consider the risks we\u8217\'92re taking. By allowing them to know we exist we start to be under permanent threat. If they use that kind of violence, we could take serious damage here. The question is: how much risk are we willing to take to help others?\u8221\'94. Daniel said: \u8220\'93Indeed. It\u8217\'92s our safety against their safety, or even their life. Quite a few people there may not be wanting the situation there. Is it fair to keep them in the current situation, just so we can stay a bit safer? We have plenty of food and other things.\u8221\'94. #Hank replied: \u8220\'93The question is: do we think that\u8217\'92s important enough to risk our own safety. I suggest we vote on that.\u8221\'94. Everyone agreed to this notion.\line The next day, they held a vote. It was almost entirely in the middle, but, a majority decided in the end on helping the people outside the group. After this vote, some voices were raised to start putting people as look-outs through the night. This would mean that they would be able to defend their territory at least a bit. \line  \line }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 They find some people, and add them to the group.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \line Daniel woke up to a smell of fire. He stretched his muscles, and walked outside, looking where the smell was coming from. It was the farm, and it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t just a small fire either. There were flames everywhere on the farm, meters high, engulfing the entire harvest. More people were streaming onto the area next to the farm, all looking in horror at the burning farmland. The fire engulfed had already destroyed all the food. Since the areas around it were concrete, there was no point in trying to take out the fire; it would only lead to a bigger mess, and a loss of water. Therefore, they just did nothing, staring at the fire. It was obvious to everyone that this wasn\u8217\'92t an accident. Plants simply don\u8217\'92t burn this heavily. Someone purposely set this all on fire. Someone did not want them to have food, to thrive, or even to survive. Someone just tore their future apart. They just stood there, in horror, and disbelief, as the fire ate their food in minutes; the food that was supposed to last them for months. \line After the fire had stopped burning, and the ground had cooled down a bit, they started to look for food that had survived, as well as clues to what could have happened. They knew almost certainly that it was arson, but who had done it was still a mystery. There was a conflict starting to grow within the group; some of the original members felt like the people they took in from elsewhere could have been responsible for the fire. Still though, this didn\u8217\'92t really make sense to Daniel, as these people would be just as dependant on this food as they would have been. After looking at the farm a bit, they realised they hadn\u8217\'92t seen the nightly watch keepers yet, and might want to speak to them. The switch of guard duties would be in an hour or so, which would be a natural moment to start asking questions. #Hank asked the people present who they thought should speak with the night\u8217\'92s guard. Daniel said: \u8220\'93I think I should go.\u8221\'94. Two more people joined him, both wearing weapons. They walked towards the bridge, where they saw that the two people that had been guarding it were no longer at their posts. They found them bound to the pillars of the bridge, unconscious. This gave them some idea of what had happened. There were some signs of a struggle, and their weapons were absent. \line \line Since the farm had gone, the survivors had no choice but to push further into the city, looking for food to scavenge. They tried their best to prevent getting into conflicts with other groups, but in some cases they couldn\u8217\'92t help it. This meant that, sometimes, people got hurt. Not just their enemies would get hurt, within two months, the number of survivors had dropped from fourty (thirty-five plus five more) to thirtytwo. It became increasingly obvious that the situation would not be sustainable. There was an attempt at restarting the farm, but it was going quite slow. There just weren\u8217\'92t that many potatoes and other crops to start the farm with, so the harvests were rather low. Besides this, it was still winter season, so the cold didn\u8217\'92t help them either. It became increasingly clear that the choice would end up being between survival and war. And nobody here wanted to make that choice.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \line Daniel had another strange dream. This time, there wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t just a voice; there was also a body that went with it. It looked human, but illuminated. The character said: \u8220\'93Hi Daniel, nice to see you again, although I wish it would have been under better circumstances.\u8221\'94. Daniel said: \u8220\'93You were right, I\u8217\'92m sorry about it.\u8221\'94. The character said: \u8220\'93You weren\u8217\'92t wrong, you were just too optimistic about people. You can hardly be blamed for that.\u8221\'94. Daniel said: \u8220\'93But I\u8217\'92ve doomed them all, nobody will survive.\u8221\'94. The character changed shape a bit, and somehow looked quite a bit more friendly. It said: \u8220\'93Yes, and no. There is still an option. Whether you want to choose it or not is up to you.\u8221\'94. Daniel said: \u8220\'93What options could possibly be left? We have two options: either to die of starvation, or to die fighting each other.\u8221\'94. The voice said: \u8220\'93There is always a third option.\u8221\'94. Daniel said: \u8220\'93What other option is there, besides suicide?\u8221\'94. The character said: \u8220\'93Well, calling it suicide would be calling it the end. However, what if it wasn\u8217\'92t the end?\u8221\'94. Daniel said: \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re supposed to have us drink poison and believe in a life after death?\u8221\'94. The voice said: \u8220\'93Well, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 You }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 are two separate things: matter and information. Your matter, as you can see, is in quite a bit of trouble. However, if you do it in the correct way, you can separate your matter from your information; your }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Idea.}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94. Daniel said: \u8220\'93I sort of can see what you were saying, but I don\u8217\'92t see how this is relevant.\u8221\'94. The character said: \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m an #}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Avatar}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , one of eleven of those. We\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re responsible for looking after }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Information}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , to try and ensure that no good things get lost to the ages. I came into this world through an information hole that was torn by a scientist. This caused the Event. In a sense, I\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92m responsible for a lot that happened over the last period of time. However, I couldn\u8217\'92t just allow you all to be moved elsewhere. This is your world, this is where you belong. You shouldn\u8217\'92t just be saved, just because you made things get tough. That\u8217\'92s part of who and what you are. Also, the }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Information }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 persists after death, through the next generations. People turn into stories, myths, besides obviously also being part of the next generation in }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Idea}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 . I mean, they get children. Now however, it looks like you all may die, without your information being able to move on. This is grounds for me to be permitted to step in.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94. Daniel thought very hard about this. Metaphysics wasn\u8217\'92t really his area of expertise, so he needed some time to process it all. Daniel said: \u8220\'93I would like to think about this first. I think we still have about a month to decide about this, right?\u8221\'94. The Avatar said: \u8220\'93At most, from what I can see. You can think about it, but I wouldn\u8217\'92t take more than a day or two. There is no reason to assume that last night was the last attack on you. Your location is known, and it\u8217\'92s known that you have things worth stealing. So, your enemies will keep coming.\u8221\'94. Daniel asked: \u8220\'93What would happen if we said yes?\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93You would have to go to a certain location, and, at a specific moment, have your }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Information}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  disconnect from your }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Energy.\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94. }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Daniel clarified: \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So, you want us to go somewhere and commit suicide?\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93Bluntly put, basically, yes.\u8221\'94, the Avatar replied. He waited for a moment, and continued: \u8220\'93I get that this is quite a lot to go through all of a sudden. You probably want to think about it, and also about how you want to convey this message to your friends, if you decide to go through with this.\u8221\'94. Daniel said: \u8220\'93I would want them to know the entire story, so they can decide on it themselves. I also want to only do it if everyone agrees; I think we should stay together until the end.\u8221\'94. The Avatar looked a him, somehow looking as though he was quite proud of Daniel. He said: \u8220\'93That would be a very honorable thing to do. It might not result in the best possible outcome, but it does sound fair, in some way at least.\u8221\'94. Daniel thought about it for a moment and said: \u8220\'93I get that it might result in us all being worse off, but this is a risk we\u8217\'92re taking. You may not be telling the truth at all, and then we would have all committed suicide based on a strange voice from a dream. Now, you could cynically say that it would then have just shortened our suffering by a month or two, but still. This is our lives we\u8217\'92re talking about, and just giving it all up. It means giving up on the world.\u8221\'94. \line \line }}
