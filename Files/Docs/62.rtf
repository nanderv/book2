\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Daniel enjoyed his coffee while he waited in, having picked a comfortable chair in the back of the room. The regular guests didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t seem to want to have contact with him, and frankly, he was fine with that. They didn\u8217\'92t really look like the sort of people that would enjoy talking about the subjects Daniel would enjoy talking about. The words he picked up seemed to be about sports. Daniel wasn\u8217\'92t a sports fan, not at all. Sure, he enjoyed playing a fun game of tennis, but he didn\u8217\'92t see why people would ever watch a sports. In his opinion, all the fun is gone when you\u8217\'92re not doing it yourself. So, instead of joining in the conversation about which sports team was gonna win, he just sat in a corner, enjoying his coffee.\line He had just finished his coffee, when the barkeep signalled to him that he should come over. He did, and was told to exit the bar, and walk left. When he saw the house with the bright yellow door, he should knock on the door, four times. Then he should wait for someone to shout back, and knock two more times. Then he should say the Inn has the best beer. Daniel went on his way, and after a few minutes he found the house with the bright yellow door. It was the ugliest door he had ever seen. He knocked four times. Someone shouted: \u8220\'93Whatever you\u8217\'92re selling, we aren\u8217\'92t buying.\u8221\'94. Daniel knocked twice, and said: \u8220\'93The Inn on this shard has the best beer.\u8221\'94. He could hear a woman start giggling. It took her almost a minute to get herself sorted out, and then she opened the door. He was met by a woman who looked like she was just over thirty years old. \u8220\'93You do know that Bob was fooling with you when he told you to say that?\u8221\'94, she said. \u8220\'93What?, \u8230\'85 oh\u8230\'85\u8221\'94, Daniel said, suddenly feeling quite stupid. \u8220\'93Anyway, my name is ##, \u8220\'93, she said, \u8220\'93and you are?\u8221\'94. Daniel introduced himself. \u8220\'93Ok, and why are you here?\u8221\'94, she asked. \u8220\'93I found a note somewhere, telling me to go there if I was the one who should go here.\u8221\'94, he said, trying to stay vague. She looked with mild distrust. \u8220\'93I had contact with someone who produces food for the Capital. He had sent a cry for help, saying they were starving.\u8221\'94, Daniel said. He continued to explain the process that had lead to him finding the house with the yellow door. \u8220\'93Ok, she said, I believe you. What do you want now?\u8221\'94, she asked. He answered that he hadn\u8217\'92t thought about that yet. He thought for a moment, and said: \u8220\'93I mostly want to know what\u8217\'92s going on. I have this strange itching feeling that something bad is going on, and that I\u8217\'92m kept out of the loop. I don\u8217\'92t know who is doing it, and why.\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93The Council; to stay in power\u8221\'94, she said. \u8220\'93Just answering the last two questions of yours, then we can focus on the first one. It\u8217\'92s hard to say what\u8217\'92s exactly going on, the Council has been keeping contact between the Capital and the Outer Shards at a historic minimum.\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93Something strange seems to be going on with the food supply. I work in the Ministry of Resource Planning, as a bookkeeper. We had problems with getting enough food. A few weeks after sending this message to the Ministry of Outer Shards, we suddenly got enough food again. Two weeks after that, I got the message about people who were starving. So, I guess there must be a pattern.\u8221\'94, Daniel said. She nodded, and said: \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a group of people here dedicated to figuring out what\u8217\'92s going on. We\u8217\'92re working on this every Thursday night. If you have time then, you can join.\u8221\'94. Daniel said that he didn\u8217\'92t know how his girlfriend would like that idea. She replied \u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t tell your girlfriend. That\u8217\'92s too dangerous. So, if you decide to join us, you\u8217\'92ll have to find a reason for you to be absent on Thursday evenings and nights. Almost all of us have people around us that we have to lie to. It\u8217\'92s just an unfortunate consequence of how the Council is treating people who are just looking in the wrong spaces. Even that can be enough to land yourself over ten years in a forced work camp.\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93One thing I don\u8217\'92t get though,\u8221\'94, Daniel said, \u8220\'93Why William?\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93Because we feel that he was framed for a crime he didn\u8217\'92t commit.\u8220\'93, she answered. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re telling me he didn\u8217\'92t tell his organisation to attack that school?\u8221\'94, Daniel said. She answered: \u8220\'93Think about it, he would have known that that would do no good. It would only aid the Council.\u8221\'94. Daniel wasn\u8217\'92t too sure about it yet. But, to his own surprise, he didn\u8217\'92t instantly disregard that thought as being a silly theory by a crazy woman. Instead, he put it in his head to think about slowly, and come to a conclusion in his own time. \line Daniel suddenly realised it must have become quite late already, and said: \u8220\'93I think it\u8217\'92s about time for me to go. Where do I need to go if I want to come into contact again. She told him, just go to the Inn on a Thursday evening, and the rest will sort itself out. He said, \u8220\'93Thank you, see you around.\u8221\'94. She said goodbye, and left the door after he left the house. He hurried back home, and was happy to find out that he was home before his girlfriend. That meant that he was still on time. He turned on the radio and tried to relax. He had trouble doing so, because his mind was just full of thoughts. }}
