\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Daniel enjoyed his coffee while he waited in, having picked a comfortable chair in the back of the room. The regular guests didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t seem to want to have contact with him, and frankly, he was fine with that. They didn\u8217\'92t really look like the sort of people that would enjoy talking about the subjects Daniel would enjoy talking about. The words he picked up seemed to be about sports. Daniel wasn\u8217\'92t a sports fan, not at all. Sure, he enjoyed playing a fun game of tennis, but he didn\u8217\'92t see why people would ever watch a sports. In his opinion, all the fun is gone when you\u8217\'92re not doing it yourself. So, instead of joining in the conversation about which sports team was gonna win, he just sat in a corner, enjoying his coffee.\line He had just finished his coffee, when the barkeep signalled to him that he should come over. He did, and was told to exit the bar, and walk left. When he saw the house with the bright yellow door, he should knock on the door, four times. Then he should wait for someone to shout back, and knock two more times. Then he should say the Inn has the best beer. Daniel went on his way, and after a few minutes he found the house with the bright yellow door. It was the ugliest door he had ever seen. He knocked four times. Someone shouted: \u8220\'93Whatever you\u8217\'92re selling, we aren\u8217\'92t buying.\u8221\'94. Daniel knocked twice, and said: \u8220\'93The Inn on this shard has the best beer.\u8221\'94. He could hear a woman start giggling. It took her almost a minute to get herself sorted out, and then she opened the door. He was met by a woman who looked like she was just over thirty years old. \u8220\'93You do know that Bob was fooling with you when he told you to say that?\u8221\'94, she said. \u8220\'93What?, \u8230\'85 oh\u8230\'85\u8221\'94, Daniel said, suddenly feeling quite stupid. \u8220\'93Anyway, my name is ##, \u8220\'93, she said, \u8220\'93and you are?\u8221\'94. Daniel introduced himself. \u8220\'93Ok, and why are you here?\u8221\'94, she asked. \u8220\'93I found a note somewhere, telling me to go there if I was the one who should go here.\u8221\'94, he said, trying to stay vague. She looked with mild distrust. \u8220\'93I had contact with someone who produces food for the Capital. He had sent a cry for help, saying they were starving.\u8221\'94, Daniel said. He continued to explain the process that had lead to him finding the house with the yellow door. \u8220\'93Ok, she said, I believe you. What do you want now?\u8221\'94, she asked. He answered that he hadn\u8217\'92t thought about that yet. He thought for a moment, and said: \u8220\'93I mostly want to know what\u8217\'92s going on. I have this strange itching feeling that something bad is going on, and that I\u8217\'92m kept out of the loop. I don\u8217\'92t know who is doing it, and why.\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93The Council; to stay in power\u8221\'94, she said. \u8220\'93Just answering the last two questions of yours, then we can focus on the first one. It\u8217\'92s hard to say what\u8217\'92s exactly going on, the Council has been keeping contact between the Capital and the Outer Shards at a historic minimum.\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93Something strange seems to be going on with the food supply. I work in the Ministry of Resource Planning, as a bookkeeper. We had problems with getting enough food. A few weeks after sending this message to the Ministry of Outer Shards, we suddenly got enough food again. Two weeks after that, I got the message about people who were starving. So, I guess there must be a pattern.\u8221\'94, Daniel said. She nodded, and said: \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a group of people here dedicated to figuring out what\u8217\'92s going on. We\u8217\'92re working on this every Thursday night. If you have time then, you can join.\u8221\'94. Daniel said that he didn\u8217\'92t know how his girlfriend would like that idea. She replied \u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t tell your girlfriend. That\u8217\'92s too dangerous. So, if you decide to join us, you\u8217\'92ll have to find a reason for you to be absent on Thursday evenings and nights. Almost all of us have people around us that we have to lie to. It\u8217\'92s just an unfortunate consequence of how the Council is treating people who are just looking in the wrong spaces. Even that can be enough to land yourself over ten years in a forced work camp.\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93One thing I don\u8217\'92t get though,\u8221\'94, Daniel said, \u8220\'93Why William?\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93Because we feel that he was framed for a crime he didn\u8217\'92t commit.\u8220\'93, she answered. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re telling me he didn\u8217\'92t tell his organisation to attack that school?\u8221\'94, Daniel said. She answered: \u8220\'93Think about it, he would have known that that would do no good. It would only aid the Council.\u8221\'94. Daniel wasn\u8217\'92t too sure about it yet. But, to his own surprise, he didn\u8217\'92t instantly disregard that thought as being a silly theory by a crazy woman. Instead, he put it in his head to think about slowly, and come to a conclusion in his own time. \line Daniel suddenly realised it must have become quite late already, and said: \u8220\'93I think it\u8217\'92s about time for me to go. Where do I need to go if I want to come into contact again. She told him, just go to the Inn on a Thursday evening, and the rest will sort itself out. He said, \u8220\'93Thank you, see you around.\u8221\'94. She said goodbye, and left the door after he left the house. He hurried back home, and was happy to find out that he was home before his girlfriend. That meant that he was still on time. He turned on the radio, poured himself a glass of wine, and tried to relax. He had trouble doing so, because his mind was just full of thoughts. Twenty minutes later #name came home. She asked him how his day went. \u8220\'93Oh, same as always\u8221\'94, Daniel lied, \u8220\'93How was yours?\u8221\'94. She answered: \u8220\'93All right, we were told our new material would be good enough after some small improvements, so we can push forwards towards a release of a new album. I still prefer our previous, cancelled material, but at least we\u8217\'92re producing again.\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s nice\u8221\'94, he answered. \u8220\'93By the way, shall we do rock-paper-scissors to see who should cook? I feel like cooking\u8221\'94, he continued. #name laughed. He played paper, she played scissors. Daniel laughed, and went to the kitchen area to start cooking. \line \line Daniel didn\u8217\'92t really have focus on his work the next day. Instead, he was thinking about how to combine being involved with the people of the Inn, while not destroying his relationship. He had found a lie that he thought was perfect. He would tell her he had found a group to work on his drinking habit. Among people who drank too much, he was far from the worst, but there were times when he was lucky to have her instead of someone else. And, with the idea of becoming a father slowly starting to materialise, the idea of fixing this problem would not be too much of a lie. Daniel felt terrible for telling this lie, but he went through with it regardless. It would allow him all the space he needed to work on himself.\line So, next Thursday, Daniel went towards the Inn. He was greeted by the barkeep, who told him to go to the back room. He was met by three other people. #womanName was there again, as was a man, and an older woman. \u8220\'93You must be Daniel, I\u8217\'92m Violet. The grumpy-looking man over there is #name#. I believe you already met #womanName\u8221\'94, the older woman said. Daniel looked at the both of them. Violet looked around a lot younger than Daniel thought she would look. She had a strong but kind posture. The grumpy-looking man was much younger. Although his hair was showing signs of him getting older, it hadn\u8217\'92t turned grey yet. From his posture Daniel couldn\u8217\'92t guess much about his character, he seemed to be a bit of an enigma. \u8220\'93So you\u8217\'92re Violet, the one that was on the note. Still working as a journalist?\u8221\'94, Daniel asked. She said, \u8220\'93Part-time, yes. There\u8217\'92s no pensioning age in the Capital, you just get to work a bit less.\u8221\'94.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Anyway, it\u8217\'92s probably best to first tell you what we\u8217\'92re doing here. But before that, I want you to know this is your last chance to step back from this. After this, you\u8217\'92re involved with us. It }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 will }{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 make you an enemy of the state.\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94. Daniel said: \u8220\'93I was aware of that when I went here. Thanks for telling me though, it would have been bad to find out the hard way.\u8221\'94.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0  She continued: \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93We should probably start by introducing ourselves. I\u8217\'92m Violet, part-time journalist. I was born in Londen, and was in my teens when the Event happened. I have had contact with members of }{\f3\fs24\b0\i1 The Voice of Reason}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  in the past, a revolutionary organisation that was blamed for some terrorist attacks, until they had enough, and decided to attack the Capital and force the change.\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94. Obviously they had failed, Daniel thought, accidentally outloud. \u8220\'93True, which is still a shame, because their ideas were pure.\u8221\'94, Violet replied. #woman introduced herself as working as a teacher, and said she wanted to know for sure that she was teaching the children the truth. The enigmatic man said his name was Bob, and that he had his own personal reasons for joining. Daniel didn\u8217\'92t feel trusted by him yet. Ah well, he couldn\u8217\'92t really blame him.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0  Violet said: \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re a small group of people, working to make people aware of what\u8217\'92s going on outside their area. We don\u8217\'92t have a real political agenda, but we believe people have a right to know what\u8217\'92s going on. Without that, people cannot freely form their opinions. As you have noticed, the current way things work does not give people context of their work, and punished people who try to find out what\u8217\'92s going on in the world around them. Besides that, we have signs that people outside the Capital get treated as second-class citizens, basically slaves.\u8221\'94. Daniel said: \u8220\'93That could very well be true. I guess #womanName told you about the message that I found on one of the cargo receipts?\u8221\'94. Violet nodded. \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s more hints than that. The problem is, it\u8217\'92s mostly all hints. We don\u8217\'92t really know what\u8217\'92s going on there.\u8221\'94, Violet said. \u8220\'93We need a mole in the government\u8221\'94, #grumpyGuy added, looking expectantly at Daniel. \u8220\'93You want me to infiltrate the government, and figure out what\u8217\'92s going on? I really don\u8217\'92t have the role within the government to get access to more information. I\u8217\'92d need to make career before I can effectively get more information. And that\u8217\'92s if I want to take that risk. I don\u8217\'92t know if I want to put my family in that position. \u8221\'94, he said. Violet: \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s to be understood. However, if you get into such a position, it would be extremely helpful if you at least passed on the information that you managed to collect. Even without taking big risks, just knowing what policies are in place can already give a lot of insight.\u8221\'94. Daniel thought for a moment; \u8220\'93I think there will be an evaluation #thing# in a month or two, I can express my wish to be promoted there. I think I\u8217\'92ve got a chance there. No promises though.\u8221\'94. #grumpyMan: \u8220\'93That would be very good news. We have some sources, but none within the department where you are working. So, your information could add new insights. Also, with the message you found, it\u8217\'92s obvious that something is going on, although none of our sources give any indication to that. This is not too unexpected though, the communication between the Capital and the Outer Shards is kept quite limited.\u8221\'94. When he returned home, his girlfriend was still waiting for him. He greeted her, and sat down next to her. He just barely resisted his urge to grab the bottle and pour himself a glass of wine. He thought: I\u8217\'92ll have to stop drinking now, anyway. He just hoped he would be able to stop on his own; it would be terrible if he would be unable to. She said: \u8220\'93If you don\u8217\'92t want to talk about it, it\u8217\'92s fine.\u8221\'94. Daniel said: \u8220\'93It went fine. I think I can do this.\u8221\'94. She smiled.\line \line A month or so later, Daniel had an evaluation session. Charles and two others were present. After formalities, Charles started: \u8220\'93I first want to thank you for your diligent work, as well as your sharp thinking that lead to the discovery of the food shortage. You enabled us to evade a catastrophe.  Therefore, we think it might be better to promote you to a position which allows you to do more of that sort of thinking. Just filling in forms seems to be a waste of your qualities. What do you think of this?\u8221\'94. Daniel answered without giving it even a second of thought: \u8220\'93Of course. I was quite sad to have to give up my research so others could work on it, so I would be happy to be moved to a spot where those skills are of more use.\u8221\'94. Charles: \u8220\'93In preparation of this conversation, I already asked around. It seems there are two spots available at the moment. One is in our own Ministry, as a Resource Planner. Your job there would be to analyse the data of incoming resources, and strategise what would be needed. You would work on resource curves, calculating the required stock levels for goods, and things like that. Alternatively, you could switch Ministries, and work at the Ministry of Outer Shards. Your task would then be more on getting the production levels themselves up to the level required. I think you would probably fit fine in either position, and you can probably get either position if you wanted it. The decision will be made higher up in the end, but if you have a preference, it will be taken into consideration.\u8221\'94. Daniel answered: \u8220\'93Can I think about it for a little bit, I\u8217\'92m not certain yet. Both seem to be fine positions, I\u8217\'92d like to think a bit on what I would prefer to be doing.\u8221\'94. Charles nodded, \u8220\'93Of course. If you think too long though, it will be chosen for you.\u8221\'94. After he saw that Daniel wasn\u8217\'92t reacting, he winked. Daniel smiled, and said: \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not sure if I would be really happy if I wasn\u8217\'92t working together with you, Charles. Both offers sound really good though. From what I heard, it seems I have to choose between doing something that\u8217\'92s an extension of my current job, and doing something new. On one hand, I think new things are probably more exciting, but on the other hand, I\u8217\'92m probably better at doing something more similar to my current job.\u8221\'94. Daniel was thinking about which job would give him more options. He decided the Ministry of Outer Shards would probably be a place to get more information about the shards themselves. \u8220\'93I think I would prefer the job at the other Ministry, if you don\u8217\'92t mind. I would miss you terribly though.\u8221\'94, he said. Charles said: \u8220\'93Anyway, I think we\u8217\'92ve just about finished this conversation, unless you have any questions.\u8221\'94. Daniel didn\u8217\'92t have any more questions, so they shook hands, and Daniel went back to his regular work spot.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Two weeks later, Daniel was told he would indeed get the opportunity to move jobs to the Ministry of Outer Shards. He moved offices a week later. The Ministry of Outer Shards was slightly less central than the Ministry of Resources. It was one of the later Ministries to be built, and basically only really took shape after the cable car system was connected. It\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s current headquarters was on the same Shard as the initial cable car station. Symbolically, it was very close to the Outer Shards. In practice though, travelling by cable car required a permit, so the distance was enormous. Daniel entered the building. At his former job, the building was a retrofitted building from before the Event, this building was newly built after the cable car line was completed. It\u8217\'92s entrance hall was a beautiful thing, with large windows overseeing the cable car line. Daniel admired the view for some times, and then went to the administration desk. He said his name, and that he was there to start on his first day of work, as a production planner. The woman behind the desk went through her files, until she found one with his name on it. She got out an envelope with a letter in it. She said: \u8220\'93Read this, it should tell you quite a few things that you need to know right now.\u8221\'94. Daniel started reading. The note wished him welcome, and told him to get to the third floor, room 3-42. So, he did. The building had an elevator, but Daniel felt more like using the stairs. It was only three floors up anyway. He was greeted by .. And .., the same two persons that took over his research, who first went over the practical details of his job. His task would be to analyse the productivities of different Outer Shards, to see where problems may be, and how to solve them. Based on that data, he would be asked to advise on possible changes in requested goods per shard. For instance, if a shard is asked for mining, but their material is of low quality, they might be asked to instead do farming, or something else entirely. He asked: \u8220\'93So, how do I start? What\u8217\'92s a good point to work from?\u8221\'94. ## replied: \u8220\'93First we\u8217\'92ll introduce you to the rest of the team, they will then work you through what needs to be done, and what can be your part in the thing. We believe teams work better if they divide up the tasks among themselves, instead of telling people top-down what to do. They should be in the canteen in a bit, so you should probably just go there and grab a cup of coffee.\u8221\'94. Daniel nodded, and asked where it was. It was on the top floor, above the main entrance hall. It had an overview of both the main hall of the building, as well as of the cable car station outside. Daniel got himself a cup of coffee, and found a spot overlooking the cable car station. He didn\u8217\'92t have to wait long; two people walked towards him. They introduced themselves as Julia and Peter. They told me I was put on the advanced planning / prediction team.  I would not be tasked as much with the day-to-day operations, but rather with the trends over the weeks, months, or years even. First, they wanted to get me up to speed on how the Outer Shards are managed. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Basically, Daniel learnt, a lot of it came down to self-management. Some Shards were declared to be local political centres, and were made responsible of ensuring the Shards around them produced what was needed. This high degree of self-management was both a blessing and a curse. It meant that the Capital didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t need to micro-manage too much, because the local management would control this. On the other hand, it also meant not all information made it to the top of the chain, sometimes making the image incomplete.}}
