\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \line The next meeting, Daniel told the others about the person they had met. There was no resistance to the idea of sending the families with children to go to this guy. Someone asked if there would be more spots available, and how they would be shared. Daniel lied that there were no other spots, and that the families alone would have a decent chance of survival, but with more people it wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t be. He was then asked if that wasn\u8217\'92t just convenient. Daniel said: \u8220\'93Well, the families will fit, probably. Sending more means giving them a higher chance that something goes wrong, and they run out of food. The only question is if they even want to survive like that. They would possibly be one of the last people left in this world, or at least in this region. They would survive, possibly, but not by a large margin. I don\u8217\'92t see an alternative though, besides the insane.\u8221\'94. Someone asked: \u8220\'93What would be the insane?\u8221\'94. Daniel said: \u8220\'93Well, for instance, believing in a higher power, and releasing your soul to that higher power, leaving the physical realm.\u8221\'94. The person replied: \u8220\'93That, indeed, sounds quite insane.\u8221\'94. Daniel said: \u8220\'93Oh well, it\u8217\'92s the only alternative.\u8221\'94. The person looked surprised: \u8220\'93Are you saying that religion is the only alternative, and it seems you\u8217\'92re suggesting a religious suicide?\u8221\'94. Daniel said: \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m suggesting giving up our souls to a higher being, I\u8217\'92m not suggesting suicide.\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not sure what\u8217\'92s the difference\u8221\'94, he got back. The people that were there were surprised at this going-on. Suddenly, #girlName said: \u8220\'93I believe you. You seem to believe what you\u8217\'92re saying, so I think we should follow you. I don\u8217\'92t see an alternative for most people here anyway.\u8221\'94.}}
