\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Within every group, there\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s people who want a more extreme version of what the group wants. Daniel was never that person. However, now that he lost almost everything, he didn\u8217\'92t really feel like continuing the struggle like it was. He got a feeling that if he were to lose everything, he didn\u8217\'92t see why others could keep it. So, he was looking for a way to prevent the Capital from winning. The Capital had threatened with weapons that would be able to destroy shards whole. So far, only once has such a weapon been used. Daniel hoped he would be able to find a few of those somewhere in the Capital still. With his new-found skill, he might just be able to sneak in and force the bomb to explode inside the Capital. This would mean having to figure out where those bombs were actually produced and stored. Without that vital information, there would be no way to execute this plan. There were two weapons factory that Daniel knew about. One was on the East Docks shard. This shard had been named after the fact that it used to be part of a Docks region in the city from before the event that was used as the base of the Capital. The East Docks were a restricted area; only people with high clearance, and workers for that area were permitted onto it. It contained multiple big #loodsen which could easily be used to produce such weapons. It also had a big bridge connecting it to one of the airfields. The airfields were also still military-only. The idea had apparently been to also use the Gliders for non-military use, but, so far, only one non-military mission was flown with them. This had been a research mission, placing sensors near the centre of the energy storm that the Capital was hovering in. After that, with the rebellion and other conflicts, the Gliders had only been used military. Since weapons of mass destruction would either have to be transported by Glider, or have to be launched on a pad similar to a Glider\u8217\'92s launch pad, Daniel reasoned that the East Docks was the only logical location to build such weapons. It would also be far enough away from the important parts of the Capital that an explosion would not do major damage. \line So, if the weapon was indeed there, Daniel would, preferably, have to launch it towards the rest of the Capital. Alternatively, it would have to explode just as it crossed the bridge. Since the gravity forces there would be much lower, the explosion would spread much further, causing major damage to some of the more central shards as well. Daniel hoped this could damage the Capital in a very disruptive way. This, combined with the lack of logistic capabilities, would possibly damage the Capital beyond repair. What made this even more insane is that the West Docks, next to the East Docks shard, contained most of the food storage for the Capital. So, an explosion near there could set fire to the food storage in the Capital. \line Daniel arrived at the East Docks in the early afternoon. Indeed, there was a security gate. The fences around the place were quite tall. There was a proper security peremiter. Daniel would, normally, have no chance to enter here without a permit, or considerable force. He had neither. However, he hoped he could sneak into the place by strategically slowing down time to a halt. He could either add his own name to the list of expected guests, or just try to sneak past. He decided to just try his powers, focussing on wanting time to slow down. He didn\u8217\'92t really know how to do so, and then remembered that he just should want something to be possible. So, he tried being past the gate, near the entrance, on a bench. It took quite some focus, but, suddenly and to his own surprise, he was suddenly sitting on the bench. He was out of breath by it, possibly because he had to run so fast. Suddenly though, he was past the first security checkpoint. He hoped that after this, the security would be more lenient, presuming that if he was let in here, that he would be permitted to be here. He stood up, and walked towards the entrance to a building whose sign said \u8216\'91Main assembly hall\u8217\'92. Sounds good, Daniel thought. There was a main entrance, with to guards standing next to it. However, there was also a loading dock. It was closed, but the door was locked with a keypad. Six keys were discolored compared to the rest. Since they all had a similar discolouring, Daniel assumed that every digit would be in the code once. Normally, trying all the permutations of six different digits would take quite some time. Although knowing }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 which }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 six digits these are, that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s still 720 different options to try. However, Daniel hoped his powers could be of help here. They weren\u8217\'92t. He couldn\u8217\'92t envision the final situation, so he couldn\u8217\'92t fasten the process. Still, 720 combinations only took him around ten minutes. After that, he was in. He was happy no alarm seemed to have been triggered by his multiple attempts. He was suddenly standing inside the main hall. It had quite a few people working there, with cranes overhead moving bigger parts of the things in there. There were a few missiles standing there, seemingly ready to be deployed. There weren\u8217\'92t any guards in this area. It must have been presumed that, if someone got in here, he or she is permitted to be in here. Daniel thought about the current situation for a moment. He realised there was very little chance of him being able to find something to sabotage of the rockets without alarming anyone, while people were working there. Therefore, he should find a spot to hide until the workers have mostly left. After that, he might be able to find something to cause the rockets to explode before they could be deployed. He found a small broom closet that didn\u8217\'92t look like it was used very often. He sat down in a corner, waiting for people to leave the place. It would still be a few hours before that would finally happen. If there wasn\u8217\'92t such a thing as night shifts here. Daniel sure hoped not, otherwise he would not be able to do this thing. After a very long wait, Daniel heard someone lock the doors. He assumed he would have the place to his own from now on. He was correct in this assumption; only he and the rockets were still there. What he first wanted to look at were the schematics. He would need to know mostly how the rocket knew when to explode. Manipulating this part would be a trivial way to get it to explode before that. He found some blueprints of the rockets in a small office connected to the main assembly hall. The rockets had two computers inside them. They would have to agree on a decision, otherwise the decision would not be made. This was to prevent early explosions due to technical problems in the computers. It was seen as better to not explode at all than to explode early. Daniel looked for the technical description of the computer systems. There should be some information about them specifically. He found a service manual for those machines. It said something about a test mode. In test mode, the computer would not verify that the other computer agreed, and just go to firing. This would mean only one computer would have to be sabotaged. For instance, changing the conditions in which it should explode could be enough. Daniel looked up the explosion conditions. It used a distance sensor on the nose of the rocket, and if the target was within five hundred meters, the rocket would explode. This, unless it hadn\u8217\'92t flied for more than a minute; in the first minute it would assume something had gone wrong instead of exploding. So, both these conditions would have to be circumvented. Although Daniel had no experience with computers, he did have some common sense. He knew that a rocket would need a way to keep track of a minute. Now, it wouldn\u8217\'92t need to be extremely precise; there was quite a margin between the minute passing and reaching the target. The idea was more that one minute would be enough to clear away from whatever launched the rocket.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \line So, to make the rocket explode early, it would have to be convinced that a minute had passed already since launch, and that it was near it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s destination. Actually, Daniel could see from the design, it could just be modified to *always* think it was at it\u8217\'92s destination. The programming, according to the document, didn\u8217\'92t care about continuously being at it\u8217\'92s destination, and would then just sit out the time, waiting for the right moment to blow up. So, all Daniel would really need to think about is how to trick it into thinking a minute had passed. Technology had evolved quite a bit, but not an extreme lot yet. Basically, the minute was timed by burning through a bit of wire. After it burned through, the circuit would no longer be complete, and the rocket would explode if it was near the target. Actually, there were four of such wires, and all four would need to be burned through. Daniel cut all four of them almost entirely through. It was good enough to make the rocket pass the self-test before launch, but not better than necessary to pass the test. This would mean the rocket would not fly for longer than a few seconds before exploding, short enough to still be on whatever location it would be at that point. The rockets seemed to be much too big to be hanged under a glider, so the rocket would have to be launched from a platform somewhere. Also, according to the design, the first stage of the rocket didn\u8217\'92t bring it\u8217\'92s own oxygen, so it would need to be launched from an oxiginated environment. Therefore, it would stand to reason that the rocket would probably be launched from the Capital. And, with all the safety measures in place, there would not really be a reason to presume it wouldn\u8217\'92t be safe to launch it from the Capital. Daniel decided to sabotage only one of the rockets, the rest he left like the regular design. He assumed there would be a checkup of whatever would be left of the rest of the rockets, so he didn\u8217\'92t want to sabotage them, at least not in the same way. He hoped the rest of the rockets would explode as well, through the fire caused by the first rocket, but he wasn\u8217\'92t sure about that. He didn\u8217\'92t understand the payload well enough to know if that would happen. It might need the trigger to explode at all, not even reacting when fire is present nearby. \line Daniel admired his work for a while, and then decided to leave. Before leaving though, he made two small lines on two of the drawings, hoping to cause some confusion to the people building the next rocket. If nothing else, it made him feel happy about it. \line After that, he looked for a spot to wait for the night to be over. He would not be permitted to leave the place yet; he would be in trouble if he tried to cross the gate. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Four hours later, people started to flow into the place again. Daniel therefore thought it would be time for him to leave soon. He thought he should wait a bit longer, so more people had crossed the gate. Before that, it would be suspicious if he left, and, besides, they would have remembered who had entered that day. Before he could easily leave though, a cleaning person spotted him there. In a split second, he answered: \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, I dropped some coffee, and I was looking for a towel or something to remove the stain.\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93The towels are laying in the bin over there\u8221\'94, she said, not entirely sure if he was speaking the truth. He took two, and went on his way. From here on, he did apply his skill to quickly get from one hidden place to the next. He didn\u8217\'92t want to get spotted again; not everyone would be as gullible as the cleaning lady. He found the lavatories, and hid in one of them. He reasoned that nobody would really notice that one of eight lavatories was out of use. The lavatories smelled of chloride, so it looked like the cleaning staff had already visited it. After a few minutes, he relaxed. He felt like he could stay there until he had found the right time to leave. \line After thinking about it for a while more, he came to the conclusion that he should probably leave  around the time when the first shift leaves. Two shifts were working in the factory, with the nightly block having nobody work there. He calculated that the shift would be over at around 15:00, three hours from now. He was properly bored, but couldn\u8217\'92t do much about it. In the end, he fell asleep.\line \line He had another strange dream. A voice was telling him : \u8220\'93What you just did will kill everyone in the Capital, as well as the Outer Shards. The cascade from the explosion, and retaliation will leave nobody alive.\u8221\'94. Daniel asked : \u8220\'93So, you want me to disable the bombs?\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93No point\u8221\'94, the voice said, with a stern #overtuiging. \u8220\'93You already set the chain in motion. What you can try to do is to get some people to be on the far-side of the furthest-away shards of the Capital. Those should stay safe from the blast, and they would survive the blast. The next launch will be in 30 hours, and they will bring three rockets to the launch platform. Two of the rockets will explode because of your manipulations, the third one will stay intact. The explosion will set most of the Capital on fire, besides instantly destroying a fair bit of it. These rockets were already strong as single units; designed to destroy a shard. Exploding two near eachother was never even considered when they were designed.\u8221\'94. Daniel said: \u8220\'93So, you\u8217\'92re asking me to look for some people, and tell them they should stand at that spot, otherwise they will blow up?\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93Yes, that\u8217\'92s what I\u8217\'92m saying. Maybe don\u8217\'92t tell them exactly that though. What I know is that everyone not outside the blast radius will die a horrible death.\u8221\'94. Daniel thought about this for a moment. He thought about who he would want to save. He thought about saving his girlfriend and son. It would save their lives, but it wouldn\u8217\'92t mean much at all. He thought about saving the mysterious man near the bench. He didn\u8217\'92t know, nor trust the guy. He thought about going to the strange house near the Inn, and to see if there were still people there. He didn\u8217\'92t go back there, because he didn\u8217\'92t want to risk him being followed, and therefore causing them trouble. But, he guessed, if they were following him, they would have stopped him before entering the base. Therefore, they probably weren\u8217\'92t following him. Or, if they were, they were doing so terribly. Daniel thought it might have been that his special powers caused them to lose his trail. If that was indeed the case, he should take some effort to stay somewhat hidden. \line He woke up, and felt like some time had passed. A few minutes later, he heard someone say: shift is over, can\u8217\'92t wait to go home. So, Daniel left the toilet, and blended into the big mess of people walking there. He thought he would blend into the group, causing nobody to notice he hadn\u8217\'92t worked there before. One person tried to start a conversation: \u8220\'93So, what are you going to do, now that you\u8217\'92re done with work for today?\u8221\'94. Daniel was surprised, but answered regardless: \u8220\'93Oh, I\u8217\'92m gonna visit an old friend. We haven\u8217\'92t spoken in a while.\u8221\'94. This was technically almost the truth. It just hinged on the word friend being rather loosely defined. However, since all Daniel\u8217\'92s friends were out of reach, he might as well consider the few people that were still in the Capital and didn\u8217\'92t provably hate him his friends. Daniel continued: \u8220\'93What about you?\u8221\'94. The guy said: \u8220\'93Oh, you know, just gonna listen to some radio, take a smoke and some wisky.\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93Mmmm, whisky\u8221\'94, Daniel replied. He felt himself get thirsty for it. He nodded to the guy and they passed through the gate. No questions were asked to the people that left. It wouldn\u8217\'92t make much sense if they were, since they had all entered the area legitimately. Still, it made leaving nice and easy for Daniel. \line Daniel walked towards the shard with the Inn. He paid attention to the orientations of shards. This shard would be one of the shards where some areas would survive. They were outside the direct blast radius, and the backside would not be hit by the heat wave either. From what he could see, the inn would be survivable, but most of the regular houses wouldn\u8217\'92t be. A lot of them were straight in the line of the heatwave. The backside of the shard had a park, and some other buildings. It wasn\u8217\'92t as densely built on, because this is quite a remote shard, and therefore some space was kept empty for people to enjoy some free space. The Capital wanted to provide everyone with enough space to also live, but, of course, space was still at a premium here, especially in the more central regions of the Capital. To prevent having to deal with the tiny housing in the center of the Capital, Daniel and his girlfriend had moved a bit out of the central set of Shards. It was a somewhat more shabby neighbourhood, but it meant, at the very least, that they were able to afford a decent amount of space for a decent price. And besides, the area they lived in wasn\u8217\'92t too terrible. It had nice children\u8217\'92s playgrounds, lots of families with children, and only a few criminal scum. They had been quite happy with the amount of space they had gotten there, and were trying to make the most of it. Still, the shard with the Inn on it trumped most other shards when it came to space. The shard had been added with the intent of filling in the green area, but when it was added, the Council noticed the green area was really enjoyed by the population of the Capital, and therefore they decided not to fill it in. They had planned to build a new highrise building there, the first one to be built for residential use since the Event. All the other high rises in the Capital had been retrofits of existing buildings. So that was the reason that this specific shard did not have that much on it. It was remote, and it wasn\u8217\'92t fully developed to what it was intended to be developed as. To some extent the project had been a flop. It barely gained back the cost of building a bridge to it. It had some housing capacity, sure, but it didn\u8217\'92t bring much to the Capital besides that. The Inn was just about the only thing of interest on that shard, and that inn wasn\u8217\'92t the most luxerious; It was actually notorious for being a place of trouble. However, the locals of this shard liked it that way. They didn\u8217\'92t like the clean types of entertainment that were preferred for most of the rest of the Capital. They liked drinking booze of questionable quality, and, after being properly drunk, to give in to their anger, and go for a nice and proper bar fight. This is why most of the interior of this bar looked like it had been repaired hastily after having been smashed; most of the interior had indeed been smashed.\line Daniel arrived on said shard, and looked for the building with the #color door. He found it after not much effort, and knocked. The same lady as before opened the door. Daniel said ..}}
