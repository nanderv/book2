\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Within every group, there\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s people who want a more extreme version of what the group wants. Daniel was never that person. However, now that he lost almost everything, he didn\u8217\'92t really feel like continuing the struggle like it was. He got a feeling that if he were to lose everything, he didn\u8217\'92t see why others could keep it. So, he was looking for a way to prevent the Capital from winning. The Capital had threatened with weapons that would be able to destroy shards whole. So far, only once has such a weapon been used. Daniel hoped he would be able to find a few of those somewhere in the Capital still. With his new-found skill, he might just be able to sneak in and force the bomb to explode inside the Capital. This would mean having to figure out where those bombs were actually produced and stored. Without that vital information, there would be no way to execute this plan. There were two weapons factory that Daniel knew about. One was on the East Docks shard. This shard had been named after the fact that it used to be part of a Docks region in the city from before the event that was used as the base of the Capital. The East Docks were a restricted area; only people with high clearance, and workers for that area were permitted onto it. It contained multiple big #loodsen which could easily be used to produce such weapons. It also had a big bridge connecting it to one of the airfields. The airfields were also still military-only. The idea had apparently been to also use the Gliders for non-military use, but, so far, only one non-military mission was flown with them. This had been a research mission, placing sensors near the centre of the energy storm that the Capital was hovering in. After that, with the rebellion and other conflicts, the Gliders had only been used military. Since weapons of mass destruction would either have to be transported by Glider, or have to be launched on a pad similar to a Glider\u8217\'92s launch pad, Daniel reasoned that the East Docks was the only logical location to build such weapons. It would also be far enough away from the important parts of the Capital that an explosion would not do major damage. \line So, if the weapon was indeed there, Daniel would, preferably, have to launch it towards the rest of the Capital. Alternatively, it would have to explode just as it crossed the bridge. Since the gravity forces there would be much lower, the explosion would spread much further, causing major damage to some of the more central shards as well. Daniel hoped this could damage the Capital in a very disruptive way. This, combined with the lack of logistic capabilities, would possibly damage the Capital beyond repair. What made this even more insane is that the West Docks, next to the East Docks shard, contained most of the food storage for the Capital. So, an explosion near there could set fire to the food storage in the Capital. \line Daniel arrived at the East Docks in the early afternoon. Indeed, there was a security gate. The fences around the place were quite tall. There was a proper security peremiter. Daniel would, normally, have no chance to enter here without a permit, or considerable force. He had neither. However, he hoped he could sneak into the place by strategically slowing down time to a halt. He could either add his own name to the list of expected guests, or just try to sneak past. He decided to just try his powers, focussing on wanting time to slow down. He didn\u8217\'92t really know how to do so, and then remembered that he just should want something to be possible. So, he tried being past the gate, near the entrance, on a bench. It took quite some focus, but, suddenly and to his own surprise, he was suddenly sitting on the bench. He was out of breath by it, possibly because he had to run so fast. Suddenly though, he was past the first security checkpoint. He hoped that after this, the security would be more lenient, presuming that if he was let in here, that he would be permitted to be here. He stood up, and walked towards the entrance to a building whose sign said \u8216\'91Main assembly hall\u8217\'92. Sounds good, Daniel thought. There was a main entrance, with to guards standing next to it. However, there was also a loading dock. It was closed, but the door was locked with a keypad. Six keys were discolored compared to the rest. Since they all had a similar discolouring, Daniel assumed that every digit would be in the code once. Normally, trying all the permutations of six different digits would take quite some time. Although knowing }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 which }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 six digits these are, that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s still 720 different options to try. However, Daniel hoped his powers could be of help here. They weren\u8217\'92t. He couldn\u8217\'92t envision the final situation, so he couldn\u8217\'92t fasten the process. Still, 720 combinations only took him around ten minutes. After that, he was in. He was happy no alarm seemed to have been triggered by his multiple attempts. He was suddenly standing inside the main hall. It had quite a few people working there, with cranes overhead moving bigger parts of the things in there. There were a few missiles standing there, seemingly ready to be deployed. There weren\u8217\'92t any guards in this area. It must have been presumed that, if someone got in here, he or she is permitted to be in here. Daniel thought about the current situation for a moment. He realised there was very little chance of him being able to find something to sabotage of the rockets without alarming anyone, while people were working there. Therefore, he should find a spot to hide until the workers have mostly left. After that, he might be able to find something to cause the rockets to explode before they could be deployed. He found a small broom closet that didn\u8217\'92t look like it was used very often. He sat down in a corner, waiting for people to leave the place. It would still be a few hours before that would finally happen. If there wasn\u8217\'92t such a thing as night shifts here. Daniel sure hoped not, otherwise he would not be able to do this thing. After a very long wait, Daniel heard someone lock the doors. He assumed he would have the place to his own from now on. He was correct in this assumption; only he and the rockets were still there. What he first wanted to look at were the schematics. He would need to know mostly how the rocket knew when to explode. Manipulating this part would be a trivial way to get it to explode before that. He found some blueprints of the rockets in a small office connected to the main assembly hall. The rockets had two computers inside them. They would have to agree on a decision, otherwise the decision would not be made. This was to prevent early explosions due to technical problems in the computers. It was seen as better to not explode at all than to explode early. Daniel looked for the technical description of the computer systems. There should be some information about them specifically. He found a service manual for those machines. It said something about a test mode. In test mode, the computer would not verify that the other computer agreed, and just go to firing. This would mean only one computer would have to be sabotaged. For instance, changing the conditions in which it should explode could be enough. Daniel looked up the explosion conditions. It used a distance sensor on the nose of the rocket, and if the target was within five hundred meters, the rocket would explode. This, unless it hadn\u8217\'92t flied for more than a minute; in the first minute it would assume something had gone wrong instead of exploding. So, both these conditions would have to be circumvented. Although Daniel had no experience with computers, he did have some common sense. He knew that a rocket would need a way to keep track of a minute. Now, it wouldn\u8217\'92t need to be extremely precise; there was quite a margin between the minute passing and reaching the target. The idea was more that one minute would be enough to clear away from whatever launched the rocket.}}
