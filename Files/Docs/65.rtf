\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Two days later, Daniel had another strange dream. He, again, was alone on a shard. This time though, it had ruins on there. With some effort, he could recognise it as Monument Island. It had all the distinguishing features, but was overgrown with weed. It looked like nobody had been there for months, if not years. There were few signs of damage, only time seemed to have played it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s part. It seemed as though people had just disappeared, leaving nature to take its course. Suddenly, he heard a voice. It said: \u8220\'93This is what happens if the fight is going to go through.\u8221\'94. Daniel asked: \u8220\'93Who are you? Why are you in my dream?\u8221\'94. The mysterious voice answered: \u8220\'93Who I am is not that important right now. What\u8217\'92s important is that we try to save whatever is left to be saved.\u8221\'94. Daniel replied: \u8220\'93But if I don\u8217\'92t know who you are, why should I trust you? How do I know that you know better what\u8217\'92s going to happen?\u8221\'94. The voice answered the second question instead of the first: \u8220\'93Think of it like this: what good is it going to do if everyone is fighting each other? Whatever things were rebuilt so far will be destroyed again. The social hierarchy will be overthrown, but what will take it\u8217\'92s place? People outside the Capital are struggling, yes, but at least there\u8217\'92s infrastructure now so food can be transported. Besides large-scale harvest failures, food gets shared, so if there\u8217\'92s a lack of food in one place, people will share. Also, there\u8217\'92s trade going on again, so not everyone has to provide for themselves. You want to destroy all of that for a political cause?\u8221\'94. Daniel answered: \u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t. I just want equality, or at least openness. It\u8217\'92s the Capital that doesn\u8217\'92t want to give us either.\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93Strong words, coming from someone who only just left the Capital. Do you really think your new friends would be more kind towards the people that would be under their power, if they had it? Or would it just reverse the roles? How do you think it would work if there\u8217\'92s scarcity then? It\u8217\'92s easy to be all for equality when you aren\u8217\'92t the one having to make the hard decisions.\u8221\'94. Daniel: \u8220\'93Sure, but that doesn\u8217\'92t mean I should just accept that the structure here is just broken forever, with no chance to change it.\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93True, but war wouldn\u8217\'92t have been the only alternative.\u8221\'94. Daniel: \u8220\'93Then you, mysterious voice, should tell me: }{\f1\fs24\b1\i0 what should I have done instead?\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 . There was no answer. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just as I thought.\u8221\'94. The mysterious voice answered: \u8220\'93Perhaps we should talk again later. We shall meet again.\u8221\'94. Daniel woke up.\line \line The plan was simple: go from Shard to Shard, telling the people there about their mission. They would have to refuel after about seven stops. So, either they would have to steal fuel somewhere, or the seventh stop would have to be near where they wanted to be in the end. That would lose them the glider, but it would mean not having to break into something well-protected. \line Everywhere they went, they were met with applause. Their story had preceded them, and they were welcomed as heroes. They told the story of their heroic fights against the Gliders, and told people about why they should also pick up their weapons and fight. They explained that if everyone cooperated, they would fight the Capital twenty to one. So, even with no way to reach the Capital, they would be able to hurt them to the point of them having to give in and grant them some rights as well. It was odd to see that, suddenly, there was no fighting going on. It almost seemed as though the Capital had given up. In fact though, they were just re-organising, and figuring out their next step. \line After three visits, they decided to do three more visits, on Shards around the secondary cable car station. If those three could be convinced to go on strike, there would be no way to get cargo in and out of the Capital. It would be locked off from the Outer Shards. And even if they managed to break one of the three strikes, they would still have a crippled input. The plan was to tell people to stop transporting, and tell people to prepare the cable car stations for sabotage. The idea was that if they were attacked, they would destroy the link with the Capital. This would mean that the Capital would no longer be connected to the rest of the Shards, and if they tried to do something about this, they would lose their connections for even much longer. The plan seemed perfect at a first glance. It was surprisingly easy for them to convince the people on these shards to go on strike. They had been wanting to do it for a while, but, without coordination they had no reason to do so. It simply wouldn\u8217\'92t have much effect, unless all three would go on strike at the same time. \line A few days later, it would be the day of the reunion. This was a celebratory day, signifying the moment the Capital was reconnected with this group of Outer Shards. Therefore, it was seen as a significant moment to choose to go on strike. Why not take a symbolic date to start your rebellion? On that day, a note was sent with the final shipment of goods towards the Capital. All three wrote on their note that they were going on strike, demanding better conditions for the Outer Shards. It stated this was a coordinated strike, and that almost all of the Outer Shards was aware of this, and agreed with it. There was no immediate response. The note stated that they would slowly run the cable car service once more the day later, holding it mid-transport for three days by applying the brakes. The reasoning was that this would mean there was no oxygen left in the vehicle by that point, so no soldiers could transport with it. They also stated that if they recognised that it was a passenger vehicle, they would hold it there indefinately. A harsh threat, but at least it meant the Capital could send one last message towards the Outer Shards before they would go radio-silent. The Capital replied: \u8220\'93We want to talk. Let\u8217\'92s meet on Octogon. This was of course a symbolic location, the first location of rebellion. It was also fairly far away, meaning the glider would run out of fuel going there. Therefore, they couldn\u8217\'92t really go there.  So, they replied: we lack the fuel to make such a trip. They didn\u8217\'92t really want to send this message, because they gave away that their Glider was practically out of commission, but it was the only thing they could really do to try and make something of the situation.\u8221\'94.  The message from the rebels included that the same reply-strategy would be used again. With this strategy, for one message to return, multiple days passed. A couple of days later, the Capital replied: \u8220\'93Ok, then what about we send you the fuel, and you refuel your Glider with it. Then we can meet at Octogon.\u8221\'94. The rebels thought about it, and decided to agree. Although they didn\u8217\'92t fully trust the Capital, they found that they had to at least somewhat listen to them and trust them, or there was no point to this situation. After comparing the fuel in substance to the fuel already in the Glider, they came to the conclusion that (a) it looked like Glider fuel, and (b) they had no way to chemically test if it indeed was Glider fuel. It didn\u8217\'92t seem to contain sand at least, so if it was sabotaged, it was done in a more sophisticated way. The rebels decided to first take a test flight with the new fuel, before they would allow mission-critical staff on-board. Losing Daniel, Sophia and Edward in a crash would probably mean the end of the rebellion, so was it reasoned. They had attracted new people, but }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 they }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 were the face of the rebellion, the others only followed. The test flight didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t turn out to be a disaster. So, they decided to take the risk and fly to Octogon. They didn\u8217\'92t aim for Octogon to begin with, first they flew in the direction of }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 Shard4}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 . They would do a short landing there, to stretch their legs, and observe Octogon from a distance. If it turned out to be a trap, they would have a chance of knowing. At least, that was the reasoning. Upon landing on }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 Shard4, }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 they saw nothing strange at Octogon. So, they flew to Octogon. When they flew over it, they saw no weapons systems there. There was three people standing there. They might have been armed, but it didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t look that way. They landed a safe distance away from them, and approached by foot. Daniel recognised one of them. It was Charles. He stood still for a short moment, reminiscing the past. How close he had come to living a normal life. It wasn\u8217\'92t meant to be for him, it seemed. He continued approaching them, before Sophia and Edward got confused by his behaviour. They shook hands, and introduced themselves. On the other side of the conversation they had Charles, #MinistryOfOuterShardsName and #vicePresidentName, representing the Ministry of Resources, the Ministry of Outer Shards, the latter being the Vice-President. It seemed the Capital had really sent their improtant people this time. And without an army to back them up it seemed. This got them suspicious, what else did they have as security then? The Vice-President took the word: \u8220\'93Hello, and thank you for meeting us. I know we would rather not have to have this conversation, and I hope this is likewise.\u8221\'94. Daniel nodded. She continued: \u8220\'93You probably already figured out that we must have some sort of security; something we held back and didn\u8217\'92t tell you? Otherwise we wouldn\u8217\'92t have come here without military force to back us up?\u8221\'94. She stayed silent , possibly to add dramatic effect. \u8220\'93Well, we have planted explosives throughout the three shards which you so cleverly took over. You see, our people could also do the math, and had predicted this would happen. All it took was taking some children prisoner, and the people there were all for planting explosives there to stop you. People are so easy to manipulate.\u8221\'94. Daniel, Sophia and Edward stayed silent. Finally, Edward, the mostly silent one, took the word: \u8220\'93Then we\u8217\'92re in a deadlock, aren\u8217\'92t we? Since we\u8217\'92re armed, we could take you three prisoner, and you have your bombs as a threat.\u8221\'94. She replied: \u8220\'93Thing is though, we\u8217\'92re willing to go through with our plan. If we don\u8217\'92t send the signals, the bombs }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 will}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  explode. The three of us would be an acceptable loss. Besides that, I don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t think you would go about killing us. History showed you had problems with that.\u8221\'94. She looked at Daniel. Charles said: \u8220\'93We were very disappointed to figure out you switched sides. What did they offer you in return?\u8221\'94. Daniel was silent for a while, and, in the end, replied: \u8220\'93The truth..\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93The truth? Does it even exist? You mean the fact that the Capital is willing to do what it takes? We kept people alive? Can you see the same about your little rebellion? Look at the destruction you have caused.\u8221\'94. Daniel: \u8220\'93That was only because you decided to attack us, instead of talking to us.\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93There was nothing to talk about. The things you proposed weren\u8217\'92t executable. It would have lead to much more suffering than would have been worth it. Our attacks were calculated to be the lesser evil.\u8221\'94, Charles replied. Daniel asked: \u8220\'93How do you know such things? You haven\u8217\'92t even bothered to listen to us! All we wanted is to be kept in the loop about what was going on. We didn\u8217\'92t even want fully equal rights, we just wanted people out here not to starve.\u8221\'94. Charles: \u8220\'93All we in the Capital told you guys is what we would need to survive, and to rebuild society. We asked for a bit more than was strictly necessary, true, but that\u8217\'92s because you can\u8217\'92t expect engineers to work on a minimal diet. They work much better if they are well-fed. If you want to know why people are starving, you should ask the people on shards such as Beta-One. They are the ones deciding who needs to contribute what. They are the ones controlling the logistics. We neither have the manpower nor the will to control it all.\u8221\'94. Daniel looked at her with disbelief. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re telling me you\u8217\'92re not responsible for what\u8217\'92s going on in the Outer Shards?\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93Well, to some extent, I guess we are. We defined the rules which are used to govern them. However, the people here in the Outer Shards are the ones that actually are awful to eachother. We are merely guilty by not providing better rules.\u8221\'94.  Daniel thought for a bit. Sophia answered in his stead: \u8220\'93So, you\u8217\'92re asking us to just go back and start living our lives as though this didn\u8217\'92t happen?\u8221\'94. #VP answered: \u8220\'93That would probably be the best for all of us, but I don\u8217\'92t see that happening. Besides that, the Capital demands some form of justice for what happened here. We could not just let this slip and expect everything to turn to normal again. We need to make an example out of this. The system has to stand, for humanity to survive.\u8221\'94. Daniel thought that it was convenient for someone who had it all to defend the system, while the people who got the bad end of the deal thought it wasn\u8217\'92t a good deal. He asked: \u8220\'93How are you supposed to have us convince our people that the system as it is is a fair system? Even if we did what you asked, it still wouldn\u8217\'92t happen. }}
