\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The world is made of information and Energy (Matter, and other energy). Normally, physics dictates that in a closed system (ie. The Universe), there is no Energy lost, and also, no Information is lost. No energy nor information can be added either. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \line With the Experiment, that lead to the Event, information entered our world. It was Information outside the normal scope of reality. After some time, it took a more worldly form, behaving soft-of as a person. However, this person-being is just a manifestation of the information that entered the world. With the addition of this information, the stability of the world is gone. \line \line At the end of the second book, the energy/physical world is broken beyond reasonable repair. However, there is hope, in leaving the world of matter and energy, and persisting solely in the infosphere. Basically, the concepts of the people would move beyond the limits of the world around them, and start existing outside the realms of energy and matter. }}
