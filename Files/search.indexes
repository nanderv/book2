            <Text>Fifty-seven tonnes of grain he mumbled to himself. Not bad for this time of year. At the current price, that rated as ### New Pounds. Although the treasury will be unhappy, the people will be fed. Though bookkeeping is not a job for everyone, it probably is the right job for Daniel ... He had been doing this for six years now, ever since he left school.

He moved on to the next trade receipt. It listed cotton, although a very low amount. He sighed, and calculated the value nevertheless, not forgetting to subtract from it for it being a low quantity. It was a measly sum, but still, it should be paid for. The bookkeeping had to be kept perfect, or at least, it had to seem that way. He continued this process for the remaining receipts, carefully calculating the required payments. A knock on his door interrupted him, just as he was working on one of the last receipts of the day. “I’m coming”, he shouted, realising that he should have been at a meeting ten minutes before. Oops.. Of course, the weekly meeting for bulk goods bookkeepers, he thought. How could I have forgotten, there’s a meeting every Tuesday.
He quickly grabbed his notebook, and left his office. In the hallway, #name2 was waiting for him. “Sorry, I lost track of time”, he said. “It’s all-right. The others probably won’t even be there yet. ”, was the answer he got. They walked through the hallway to the main staircase. One floor down, they found the meeting room. It was a larger office, with a round table in it. Four people were already seated there, with the two entering this means a meeting of six people. Four of them, Daniel, ##, ## and ## were bookkeepers. Charles was overseeing the meeting, and Ellen was responsible for transcribing the meeting. 
Daniel loved the view from this room. A window overlooked the Monument, as well as two of the bridges connecting the Monument island. Especially in the late afternoon, when the light cast shadows over Monument island, it was a sight to behold. There was a mass of people flowing between the trees and statues on the island. Some people were standing still, admiring the music and art made by the people on the streets. From the meeting room, it looked almost more like an anthill than a central part in a city. 

“Let’s start”, Charles said, bringing Daniel back to the matters at hand. “Are there pressing matters to discuss before going through the list?”, Charles asked? #name3, usually silent, raised his hand a little. “Yes?”, Charles said. “Did anyone else get enough cotton? My supplies have been dwindling.”, #name3 stated. “Not me”, #name1 said, looking at the last two bookkeepers, “Anyone else?”. They shook their heads. “Do we have any indication on why this is the case?”, Charles asked. He continued: “We have to sort this out before the winter season starts, otherwise people will be freezing.”. “The cold weather of the last few months was blamed by my suppliers”, Daniel said, “It is probably the same everywhere.”. The other bookkeepers confirmed his statement. After thinking for a while, Charles asked: “Would it help to increase the price for cotton?”. “It will not, because they don’t have more cotton than this.”, said …. Charles asks if there are other options to leverage more cotton. “There are none”, Daniel said, “cotton that isn’t there will not magically appear.”. Charles said he would contact the Ministery of Outer Shards to see what could be done. The others nodded in agreement. 
They moved on to the regular agenda of the meeting. Besides the cotton, the other resources were going as expected. Grain and other food was doing very well this year. Construction materials were also up by a decent margin. It was really just the cotton that was lagging behind. 
After the meeting, Daniel finished his last two trade receipts. Then, he wrote a short daily report. After that, he had done what he needed to do and left work. It was halfway through autumn, and the leaves on the trees had turned from green to yellow and red. He crossed the Monument island on his way home. The weather was nice, and it was quite crowded there. 

He turned right, crossing over to the market district. The market district was even more of a maze than most of the rest of the Capital. There were stalls everywhere, randomly scattered around. There was only just enough space in between the stalls to walk around. Some market stalls were temporary, barely more than tables with a cloth roof; some other stalls were of more temporary nature. There was also one main street, with permanent shops. Daniel loved roaming here, looking for nice finds. As he was walking around, he remembered he wanted to buy some flowers. There was no special occasion, he just wanted to surprise his girlfriend. He walked randomly through the market until he found a flower stall that he liked. It had flowers in every color imaginable, and then some. He thought for a moment, and decided to …

Having bought flowers, he went home. It was a fifteen-minute walk, crossing two more bridges in-between. He lived together with his girlfriend in an apartment, on the fifth floor of a seven-floor building. The building looked a bit dilapidated compared to the rest of the capital, but it was still quite a decent place to live. This building was constructed before the Event, but recently renovated. They had tried to make it look nicer, by adding a bit of colour, and some art. However, there is only so much you can do with giant towers of concrete. Daniel entered the front door, and walked up the staircase. There was an elevator, but he didn’t fancy using it. It was a tiny elevator, and he was a little bit claustrophobic. He entered his home, hiding the flowers behind his back. The apartment was had a bathroom, a living room and two bedrooms. The kitchen was connected to the living room. Since they had currently only a need for one bedroom, the second one was used for storing things. Daniel entered the living room, and was greeted by the cat. His girlfriend was not home yet, she must have still been at work. 
Ah well, he thought, then I’ll need to hide the flowers for when she gets home. He put them in a vase, and hid them behind a couch. He looked at the clock; 17:00. He turned on the radio, got himself a glass of wine, and waited for his girlfriend to get home. He didn’t start cooking yet, because he didn’t know when she would be home. Her working hours were a bit irregular. A short hour later, she arrived, and sat down next to him. She looked tired, so he asked her how her day went. She answered: “It was tiring. We had presented some ideas for new music, but they were not accepted by our higher-ups. Apparently, our songs were too anti-government or something. No, I don’t get it either. But this means that we have to do all that work again.”. He answered: “That sounds terrible. Is there anything you can salvage from your work though?”. She sighed, “Not much, apparently the tone of the music is already the problem. Enough about my day though, how was yours?”. Daniel answered, “Well, it was fine. I almost forgot the meeting again though.”. He didn’t tell her that he needed to be reminded of it by a colleague of his. She laughed: “Working hard again?”. He nodded. While talking, he had sneakily grabbed for the flowers, and presented them to her: “Surprise!”. She was indeed surprised, and smiled. “So, now you’re expecting me to cook?”, she asked, still smiling. Daniel asked if she was offering to do so. She said: “What about rock-paper-scissors”. Daniel sighed. She always beat him at rock-paper-scissors. Yet, it’s still, in theory, a fair game, so he felt he had no option but to say yes. Daniel played rock, #girlfriend paper. Slowly, Daniel got up and started cooking. 

In the Capital, it was easy to forget that the world had almost ended forty years ago. Life had seemingly fully bounced back to it’s former glory. Sure, not everything was back, but people were living their lives again. Especially in the weekends this was easy to see. On Saturdays, people did shopping. Not just for the things they needed for survival, but also for things they wanted. They might buy some cassettes to listen to music, books, or other things. Also, on the Saturday night, a lot of entertainment was available. For Daniel and his girlfriend, Saturday often meant going to a concert. She often had to play, and he had no option but to be there as a guest. To people unaware of the structure of the Capital, it might seem strange that a musician is able to survive within such a small town, and few options for selling your music outside the Capital. This was true, but didn’t take into account that some artists were subsidised by the Council. The Council also saw it as their task to make sure some cultural progress was made. All they asked in exchange is to have some say in what gets made. This Saturday, #girlfriends band had been planning to showcase some of their new work, but now that that work was forbidden, they would have to rely on playing some of their older work. The crowd probably wouldn’t mind much. They were mostly there to enjoy the ambiance and the beer, and didn’t care as much about which band was playing. To #girlfriend however, it felt like her art was being limited. And, like most other artisan people, this didn’t go well with her. 
Her band decided however that it wasn’t wise to go against the hand that fed them, and, begrudgingly, they only played accepted material that Saturday. The crowd seemed to enjoy the night regardless of this fact. Daniel enjoyed seeing her play live, because, even when she was annoyed at not being able to play what she wanted, she still was having fun. 

On the next Tuesday, there was another meeting. The situation with the cotton had not been improved up to this point. They were told by Charles that the cotton problem was being worked on by higher up people, and that there should be a solution soon. Daniel asked what the solution was, but was told by Charles that this wasn’t told to him either. Daniel decided not to ask further questions, not expecting answers. He did have a bit of a strange feeling about it, and wasn’t sure what that was coming from. 
Two weeks later, the cotton production improved, just in time for the winter season. This meant the clothing factories could get working. There were a few clothing factories near the Capital, providing clothes and other cotton-products for the Capital and the nearby shards. This meant that the promise of new clothing was kept by the Capital. It may not have been the most world-shattering promise, but if the Capital said something, they would arrange that that would get done. It was this promise which allowed the Capital to grow to be the centre of this new nation, and breaking this promise could have lead to terrible consequences. Or at least, so had Daniel been told. 
The thing that intrigued Daniel was that the price of cotton hadn’t increased. He would have expected this to be true, but it wasn’t. The suppliers that used to provide little now provided more. He wasn’t able to figure out what had caused this change, and therefore it stuck in his head. 
When he came home on the day he saw the increase in cotton production, he was silent. He was mostly staring at the ceiling, trying to solve the mystery, but came up empty. When # asked what was wrong, he answered, “Something was bothering me at work, but that you probably won’t think much of it.”. She answered, “Tell me what it is, then I can tell you what I think about it.”. He sighed and explained the situation to her. After thinking about it for a moment she answered: “Well, maybe they found out that there was just a problem with the quality of the product. Or perhaps there was a problem with harvesting. Or maybe there was just a misunderstanding in how much was actually needed. Who knows? It’s mostly nice that it’s fixed.”. Daniel answered, “But why aren’t they just telling us what was wrong?” She answered, “Because they like their secrets. I don’t know why, but they just do.” Daniel looked at a point in the distance. Finally, he answered: “Maybe that’s the thing I have a problem with, secrets.” She answered again: “Aren’t you overdramaticizing a bit over a bunch of cotton? I mean, there’s plenty of problems in the world, sure. But I don’t see how this thing, however weird it may be, is a real problem.”. Daniel answered: “Perhaps you’re right.”. They were silent for a while. #girlfriend broke the silence, asking: “Who’s gonna cook? Rock Paper Scissors?”. Daniel said: “Sure, I don’t mind cooking again.”. Daniel played Scissors, #girlfriend played Rock. With a sigh, Daniel got up, and started cooking. #girlfriend got up, saying: “You know, it’s probably more fun if we just cook together. I just like winning.”. 

There was a separate section of the market, just for food. It was closer to the cargo terminals, because there are types of food that perish more quickly. The food part of the market was the most organised part. This meant that you could actually find what you were looking for there. In the rest of the marketplace, you would just walk until you found something that resembled the thing you were looking for. Finding the same shop twice pretty much required a deal with the devil to achieve. Besides this, almost everyone who visited the market ended their visit feeling like they found the thing they set out to find. It just required of it’s guests to be a bit free-thinking in what they were looking for. For instance, if you were looking for a present for a friend, the market could easily provide you with unique presents. If you were looking for one specific type of present, it could sometimes take you a long time to find it , if at all. Dennis was looking for his regular set of groceries. His girlfriend had given him a list, but after inspecting it, he came to the conclusion that it was just the regular list. Even in the relatively organised food market, there was still plenty of theatre going on. Salespeople were actively advocating their produce, The freshest fish, the greenest vegetables, everything was the very best possible product. That is, if you were to believe the salespeople. Of course, if you did believe them, you would end up paying double the actual price of the product, if not more. There were also stores with fixed prices, but these only offered non-perishable food. The fresh food was only sold by the shopkeepers at the stalls. Daniel had developed a feeling for where the shopkeepers would be that he would need. He did not fully know how the market was set up, but, over time, he had developed a feeling for where the shopkeepers should be that he likes to visit. For instance, there was a shopkeeper that sold fresh loafs of bread. His bread was of exactly the type that Daniel and # enjoyed eating. He even got a discount there for being a regular customer, so that was also something nice. With his discount, the price was about equal to what bread was going for in other stores, but it was ‘proper’ bread. He also picked up rice and pasta at the same store, and continued on. 

Nothing of much consequence happened in the weeks after the cotton-incident. Daniel hadn’t really given it much thought afterwards the day on which it happened. Instead, he happily focused on what he was good at: administration without mistakes. For a lot of people, a job like his would not work. His job was a small task within a bigger flow of tasks. He hadn’t even been fully explained what all the other people were doing; instead he was just given a broad outline of the process, and what his task was within the process. A short summary is that the Capital needs certain materials. To accommodate these needs, certain buy orders are placed. These buy orders are a form of taxation, although shards get money in return. They can’t refuse the orders though. Daniels task is to ensure that the shards get the proper compensation for the produce they made for the Capital. Others were responsible for deciding what needed to be produced, as well as what could be produced by each shard. This was the responsibility of another ministry in entirety though, so he knew even less about that. He had heard some things during meetings, but other than that, he was totally unaware of these processes. Although this did annoy him a little bit, he could see how this would increase efficiency across the organisation. And the Capital was all about doing things with maximum efficiency, be it bookkeeping, or be it art. 

When the winter season start, crop yields lower. This is natural. In the world before the Event, farming was season-bound, but since the Event, the differences between Summer and Winter have been smaller. Also, since there’s a lot more light at night now, plants grow quite a bit faster. Some plants that is, some others have serious issues with the lack of proper nighttime. Some farmers even resort to putting shelters over these plants at night, just so they still get a period of night. However, as autumn turned to winter, Daniel noticed the numbers were dropping more quickly than in the years before. When he had collected enough data, he decided to mention it on the next meeting. So, when asked if there were exceptional things, he took the word: “I don’t get nearly as much food as I should at this time of year.”. Charles interrupted, saying “it’s normal for the numbers to lower as winter approaches.”. Dennis answered, “Yes, I know. As I was about to say: they are lower than any of the last five years. I checked my notes. And it’s even quite significant. I think we should look into this.”. Charles asked the others if they had seen similar patterns, but they hadn’t thought to look into their historic data. Charles said: “Then I suggest Daniel and I look into that, after the meeting. There’s no point in discussing this further until we have fact.”. The rest agreed.The rest of the meeting wasn’t of much interest to Daniel, and he wasn’t really paying much attention. 
After the meeting, they moved to Charles’ office. It was similar to Daniel’s office, but a bit bigger, and with a superior view. Charles asked: “So, what do you want to do?”. Daniel said: “First I would like to collect all the historic data from the archive, and then compare it to the data from this year.”. “That will take a while”, Charles answered, obviously annoyed at the thought of spending much time on going through all those files. Daniel observed the annoyance, and stated: “I could work through it, and give you a summary if you want to. There’s no reason for both of us to have to go through it. I just need you to sign off that I’m permitted to take the documents from the archive, I’m not permitted to do so without your permission.”. “Of course. I’m not sure if that’s the wisest solution, I feel like I should be involved with this”, Charles said. “I just wanted to give you the option. When shall we begin working on it?”, Daniel said. Charles answered that he could go to the archive to pick up the required documents now, and that they could start working on it right away. “It’s not the kind of thing we should wait for long with, this could create huge problems”, Charles stated. “Then I’ll just finish what I was working on, and wait for you to return”, Daniel answered. He had preferred to work alone on it, because he preffered doing things like this on his own. It’s not that he hated to be around people, it’s just that he felt like the puzzle wasn’t as much fun if someone else gets to solve half of it. He finished the things he still needed to do that day, and waited for Charles to return. Since the archive was largely on paper, requesting old data back could take a while. In this case, they would want data back from up to six years ago. The only reason Daniel had been able to do it more quickly himself was that he still had his own personal summaries of the work he had done. His colleagues were less vigilant at their jobs, so they didn’t have such an archive, causing Charles to have to ask for all the data from the last years, after which Charles and Daniel would have to go through it by hand, and extract the required totals. 
Charles returned with multiple boxes of paperwork on a trolley. Daniel went to his office with him, and they started on putting the boxes in-order. They started with the data from last year. Indeed, last year seemed to have much more productivity than this year. One year does not make a pattern of course, but it was still a good starting point. We carefully wrote down the numbers, and continued to the previous year. At this speed, it would take us multiple days to complete, since we also had our regular tasks to complete. We were willing to stay later for the next couple of days to figure it out. 

Daniel’s girlfriend was less happy about this, “Why did you decide to work for extra hours, instead of arranging that you could do it during the regular hours”, she asked. Daniel’s thought for a moment, thinking of a strategic reply. Finally, he answered: “I know it sounds insane, but we would have never been permitted to do this research ourselves if we didn’t do it in overtime. And we didn’t want to push it off to someone else, because we wanted to know for ourselves.”. She asked him: “Why do you want to know so badly? There’s other people working on finding these things out, it isn’t your job to worry about those things.”. Daniel answered, “I’m sorry, I can’t help it, I just really want to work on this.”. She stayed silent. Daniel knew she didn’t like his choice, but he didn’t want to change it. He tried to think of a way to convince her, but couldn’t really find one. Instead, he said: “I know this is annoying for you, I’m sorry about that. It’s just really important for me to do this.”. She continued to say nothing.

The next day, Charles and Daniel met at 16:00, after both had finished their regular tasks. They worked through two more years, both years confirming Daniel’s earlier observation. Charles said: “I think we should report on this already. This is too important to wait for three more days with reporting it to the people that are above me. This could possibly be catastrophic even.”. Dennis agreed: “I don’t think there’s much doubt that there’s indeed something very wrong here, and that the food supply will be in trouble if no action is taken. When you report it though, can you try to arrange it so that I can stay a bit involved, or at least get back the results of the research?”. Charles confirmed that that would indeed be fair, and that he would see what he could do. In the meantime, while he relayed the information to his superiors, Daniel could continue working on it if he wanted, Charles said. So, Daniel continued working on it indeed. Though he didn’t find much additional information, he managed to complete one more year before Charles got back, with two other people. Daniel had seen those once or twice before, they were two layers of management above Charles, so three above Daniel. When they saw him still working on it, they asked for his attention. Daniel looked at Charles, who seemed to be annoyed. Bad news, Daniel thought. “Hello, I’m Bob, and she’s called …”, one of the two mysterious persons said. They were wearing …, and looked like they meant serious business. “We heard you’re working on some research into a possible problem with the food supply. Can you show us what you found?”. Daniel said “OK”, and showed them the evidence. They looked at each other, possibly surprised by the matter at hand. … took the word, stating: “Thank you for showing us. We heard from Charles that you want to continue working on this. Unfortunately, due to reasons beyond our control, we can’t accept that request. We also can’t tell you about the results of this project, state policy demands thus. We also request of you that you stop doing further research into this, we’ve got this. There’s no point in spending needless work on this. Regardless, thank you very much for your hard work, we are happy to have you working for us.”. Daniel was not at all happy about this, obviously. He asked her: “Is there nothing you can tell me about the next steps? I feel like something I worked on very hard is just taken out of my hands, without explanation.”. She apologised, but said there wasn’t anything they could do. Daniel said: Alright, in that case, you probably want the boxes now, right?”. She nodded. Daniel: “Just give me a moment, I’ll sort them for you. All the papers are currently laying here systematically, so it’s best if I just put them back in the correct order. It should only take a couple of minutes.”. Bob said: “Sure, we can wait. Take your time.”. Daniel carefully forgot to mention the summaries he still had in his personal notebook. He reasoned that if they don’t ask, he doesn’t have to give it. After taking the boxes, Bob and ## left again. Charles thanked Daniel for his work, and also left. Daniel decided to also go home, because there was no point in staying to do more work. 


For three more weeks, the food production continued to drop. Then, as though nothing had ever happened, it increased to normal levels. One by one the producing shards started to produce their regular amountsfor the time of year. In the first meeting after some of them had started to produce again, Daniel stated that the productivity had gone up. Charles confirmed: “The Ministry of Outer Shards indeed worked on it, and found a solution. They found a way to increase productivity back to the required levels. They were not open for further questions, stating it wasn’t necessary for us to know, so we don’t get to know it. And besides, the problem was solved, so it isn’t important.”. The rest of the team nodded, feeling certain that the system as it was in place was able to effectively solve problems. Reassured, they continued doing their jobs as usual.

Most people would have never noticed a tiny detail on one of the receipts. Daniel was not most people though. His colleagues didn’t really bother to read the entire documents, assuming it’s always gonna read the same anyway. However, upon close examination, Daniel saw that there was something strange about this specific one. At the edge of the document, there seemed to be tiny markings. Upon closer examination, they seemed to be letters. He got his magnifying glass, and started reading. It said, “This is too much, we’re starving.”. That was all it said, but it was more than enough. Daniel stared out of the window, trying to think of what to do with this. If he told his superiors, the person who wrote this would be found, and punished, severely. Hiding messages in official documents was something that was very much illegal. And this wasn’t just a ‘John says hi’; this was a cry for help. The problem was however that if he didn’t tell his superiors and this got found out about, he would get punished. It might not be the most severe punishment thinkable, because it would be his first digression, but it would not go without serious consequences nevertheless. Daniel was thinking about talking to someone about it, but decided against it. Charles would just send a message to his superiors, and he didn’t want his girlfriend to also take the hit if it got found out about. Besides, telling her was already breaking the rules to begin with. So, he concluded, it was up to him to decide on what happened about this. The easiest option would be to report it to his superiors. In that case, the person who wrote it would be found, and punished. This was in accordance with the law, but he felt that that would not be reasonable. Someone knew about this risk, and decided to send this message regardless. Therefore, it must have been important to them to send this. Either that, or the Council was testing their vigilance, and if they were able to spot such details. The second option was to ignore it, and forget that the message was ever received. This would mean that, probably, nothing would happen. Neither Daniel, nor whoever wrote this note would be in trouble. The third option was to do something with the message. This would mean Daniel could get into serious trouble for it. However, if there’s actually something going on that causes the people on the Outer Shards to send more food than they can miss, this might be the only fair option. Daniel decided he would think about it more. He decided to handle the document as regular, but to write down the information of this receipt, so he could contact them by replying to a later order. Since each person in the department handled a fixed set of shards, this would surely happen at some point in the not-too-far future. He decided not to tamper with the note on the document. This meant that there was a small chance that it could be found when it was archived, but it also meant that he wouldn’t be in trouble if someone was testing him. If he altered the document, it would show that he was aware of the note, and wanted to destroy it. He did feel sorry for the people on …, but didn’t see another option. He couldn’t really start a fight with one of his superiors about this, or demand an explanation from another Ministry. At least, not without knowing what was going on. He thought about taking this to the press, but decided against it. This had two reasons. Firstly, the press was owned by the government, so there was a huge risk of him being caught. Secondly, he had no proof, besides a note on a single document. A note he could have easily put there himself. 
So, he decided to just wait. A week later some farmers were arrested. They had started shipping anti-government texts with their food. The Council decided to make an example out of them, so their trial was done quite publicly, with the trial being broad-casted live on the television system. They were put on trial for treason, as most people seemed to be. During the trial, evidence was shown of them not doing work, instead demonstrating against something. The reasons they were demonstrating were blurred out, on purpose, to prevent their demonstration from having effect. ‘Don’t give them an audience’ is one of the mantras of the way the Council dealt with people who demonstrated against them. The verdict in the end was that they were guilty. They were sentenced to five years of forced labour on the mining shards. Besides high-profile political cases, the only punishments given were forced labour and the death penalty. The luxury of keeping people that didn’t do any work simply wasn’t possible in the #system. People without a possible purpose generally were looked down upon. People had moved on from actively killing people who weren’t able to be useful, but they still weren’t treated as full. The situation had improved a bit since there was a law put in place that Shards had to take care for the people that needed the care, and progress was apparently made. Though harsh, the reality of the world is that there are only very few resources to begin with, so to also have to share them with people who can’t be of any use is a luxery which is not really possible, unless they were seen as important. All Daniel knew was that disabled people, and other people who needed help were treated with respect on paper, but in practice, they were really seen as a lower caste of citizens. 
Daniel had a sour taste after the trial. There hadn’t been demonstrations that lead to arrests for five years now. Generally, the government tried to just keep the demonstrations local, because the expense of arresting people often wasn’t worth it. Contain and ignore was often seen as a better policy than to actively go after people. This meant, in Daniel’s opinion, that the Council probably was trying to send a message. To whom, and why he didn’t know. He guessed it may have had something to do with the message he received earlier. The council probably felt that they needed to tell people to stay in line, and that they didn’t accept people to refuse their orders. After giving it some deliberation, he decided to send a message back to the shard which had sent out the cry for help. He just felt like he needed to know what was going on. He got the feeling that he wasn’t told the whole truth, and that something was not right. After giving it some thought, he decided that the next time he would get the chance, he would write a message on the same spot where they had written the initial message. Just the matter of finding a way to write that small. He decided to practice writing letters at micro-scale, and figure out which letters he could write that small. Obviously, something like a ‘l’ is easier to write than a ‘r’ or ‘w’. Still, even with some letters being confused for other letters, the other side should be able to figure out the message, if chosen carefully. Daniel wanted to go for a message that was simple, clear, and not too incriminating if caught. He decided to go for ‘Can I help?’. Simple, and short enough to look like a smudge to the unsuspecting eye. After that, he finished his work, and went home. In the weeks that followed, Daniel forgot partly about the message he had sent back. Life slowly reverted back to normal. Everything at work became boring and predictable, and Daniel’s private life also started to settle down. They had been talking about getting a child for some time, and had decided that it was time to stop talking. 
Three months later, as Daniel had almost forgotten about what had happened, he received another message. ‘Find Violet .., Times yy-mm-dd’, it said. Daniel was confused, he knew nobody by the name of Violet. Times xx-yy also was quite vague. After thinking about it for a while, Daniel thought it probably referred to a certain issue of the Times newspaper. Yy was then the year, with dd the week number. Daniel recognised the year; it was a well known year, taught in every history class. It was the year terrorists had taken hostages in the television studio. This was his first direct clue. So, he needed to go to the newspaper archive in the Library, and figure out what it exactly said in that specific issue of the newspaper. The next day, after work, Daniel went to the Library. He entered the huge hall, filled with books, newspapers, and other documentation. It looked like it had already been an old building when the Event happened. It had been restored with love though, and was a sight to behold. The roof was at least twenty meters above the ground floor, and on the sides were two side-halls with multiple floors in them. All floors were overlooking the central hall. Daniel already knew where he had to go: east side-hall, second floor. That part of the library was filled with rows upon rows of boxes filed with newspapers. They were sorted by date, so it didn’t take too long to find the correct date. Mostly, the boxes were one box per week, sometimes one box per two weeks, but for this specific date, one box was just for this date. Daniel picked it up, and walked to a table nearby, a bit out of the regular walking paths. He started scanning through all the newspapers inside the box. There were quite a few with articles written by a Violet. He assumed that was the Violet that the message talked about. He couldn’t really make sense of the hint though. Although he found a Violet, he didn’t know how it helped to know of a specific journalist that wrote articles #years# ago. Then he saw that in one of the articles it was mentioned that she was the journalist famous for interviewing William. William, who had been the leader of the Voice of Reason for a while. The Voice had been a terrorist organisation that, for a while, had some successes. At some point, William, their leader, had been caught, and put to trial. Before this trial, Violet had been tasked with trying to figure out what motivated him, to see if he had a chance to better himself. From these interviews, it became obvious that he couldn’t be changed, and he was put to death. Daniel had heard of this before, and seeing the name caused him to remember this. He also remembered that there was a shrine to William on the Monument Island. In the Capital, it was quite normal to build shrines to fallen enemies. This was done to show people that the Council was able to protect them, and that if they decided to revolt, they would regret it. 
Daniel decided to head to Monument Island, to see if he could find more clues at William’s tomb. After crossing the bridge from the library to Monument Island, he looked for the part where the anti-heroes were buried. It was quite clear which part it was. The design of that part was much less positive and next to every tomb was a sign explaining what that person had done wrong. Daniel was one of the few people walking this corner of Monument Island. The few people that came there seemed to come there to take a stroll, and feel like they were taken care of. Where the other parts of Monument Island had flowers, and other beautiful things on the monuments, here they were all big and empty. It was obvious that it was designed to look imposing, not beautiful. 
There was no real order in how the monuments were placed, yet William’s one was easy to find. His one had been blown up by a terrorist a few years ago, and therefore had had to be rebuilt. Therefore, they decided to put it on such a spot that it was even more visible, and to show the people who still thought his ideals were good what the capital thought of them. Well, the ideals weren’t really the problem, it was the fact that they were unwilling to cooperate. The text near his tomb said that William was first responsible for major social unrest, because of spreading radical and unachievable ideas. But the thing he was convicted for in the end wasn’t his idea. The text said that his ideas wouldn’t have been grounds for the punishment he was given. Since William’s ideas weren’t becoming reality, he had decided that if it couldn’t be his way, he might as well just start destroying things. Therefore, he had told some of his people to attack a school with children in it. Daniel wondered why this was of significance to the person who sent him the messages. It hardly seemed to be someone to be associated with. Ah well, thought Daniel, time to observe the Tome itself to see if there’s something special about it. From it’s entrance, it had a staircase leading up. On both sides of the staircase was a wall with a statue on it. Two blindfolded characters holding scales were standing on top of the walls, one on either side. On the tomb itself, a date was carved; ##  - ## - ##. Daniel noted it down in a small notebook. He walked around the tomb, looking for something else he might have missed. On the back of the tomb, he found a small note. It read: “If you are the person who should read this, head to the xx Inn, and ask if the summer has ended yet.”. Obviously a code sentence, is what Daniel thought. He had seen this inn once before; his girlfriend had played there once, before she joined a band. He didn’t remember much from the place, except that it wasn’t too centrally located. From the light, he could see that it was starting to get a bit late, and went home. He would have to visit the Inn later. He didn’t want to have to explain to his girlfriend why he was any later than he already was. Currently he could still say that it was busy at work. It would be a lie, but if you’re 30 minutes after your regular time, it still would sound reasonable. If you’re late by three hours, of course, it wouldn’t. 
His girlfriend had already cooked dinner when he got home. She had only just finished cooking, so he obviously wasn’t that late. “Sorry I’m late, it was a busy day”, Daniel said. His girlfriend looked at him with an annoyed look, and sighed. Daniel didn’t know what to do about the situation. On one hand, he really loved her, but on the other hand, he didn’t know how she would react if he told her what was going on. And if he didn’t tell her, he would have to lie quite a bit to her, in order to get the time required to get the time to do what needed to be done. And it was not like he didn’t want to be with her. Daniel would much rather just spend his time with her, but he felt like he just had to figure out what was going on. He didn’t know why he felt like he had to, but he did. He decided to sleep on it for a night, and see if he could come up with a solution in the following days.
He decided in the end that the only thing he could think of was to ask for some time off at work. He asked Charles if he could go home early the day after. Charles said that if he arranged that his work would not lag behind more than a day, he could. Daniel agreed to this, so he could take the afternoon off. Daniel hadn’t taken more than a couple of days off in total, so Charles wasn’t hard on him with respect to off time. If Daniel asked for it, he must have a reason is what he probably thought. So, after working with a speed above is already decent normal pace, Daniel left the office around two. This gave him a couple of hours to visit the Inn. He knew it was in the lower living district. It wasn’t the nicest of areas, about as bad as it gets in the Capital. In summary, it was still quite decent. It would take Daniel a thirty-minute walk to get there. The Capital was working on a transit system, but it was far from being operational. There were ideas, both cable cars and monorails, but they were seen as too expensive, and lacking the required capacity. Also, the geography of the Capital doesn’t really lend itself for regular transit systems. It was a connected system of fourteen shards, interconnected by bridges. To get from one place to another, you would cross bridges and shards until you got there. From his work, Charles would move through three different shards before he got there. The bridges weren’t built to minimise travel distance, but instead were built to minimise the number of bridges needed. There were a few more bridges than were needed to minimally connect everything, but those were mostly in the centre of the Capital. So, most routes involved a lot of walking the wrong way to get to a Shard from where you could start going the correct way. However, most people travelled from the shards outside the centre  to head to the centre and back, so, for most travels, the bridge network was quite adequate. It’s just if you want to go from one non-central place to another non-central place that it can be very ineffective. 
Daniel needed to look quite a bit when he got to the shard on which the Inn should be. It had changed quite substantially since he last visited it; it got modernised quite a bit. It actually looked somewhat decent. As he remembered it, the Inn was in a side-street from the small plaza where the bridge connected. When he last visited this Shard, it only had one bridge connection. Now it had two. The shard that was connected from the shard with the Inn on wasn’t connected yet when he last visited. Daniel remembered that the Inn was quite close to the bridge on which he entered the Shard. So, he decided to just look around. After a while he found the Inn. It had a new sign, that’s why he hadn’t recognised it instantly. The note still mentioned the old name, but it was obvious that it was the same inn, since it was on the same location where the old one was. The person who wrote the note just wasn’t consciously aware of the name change yet. Daniel entered the door, and was greeted with a few looks of mild distrust. It must have been obvious to the regular guests that he wasn’t one of them, and they looked at him with distrusft. Daniel walked up to the barkeep, and said: “Hello, excuse me, can you tell me if summer has ended yet?”. The barkeep looked up in a bit of surprise, and said: “No, it hasn’t. In about an hour, maybe. Arrangements will have to be made. Beer?”. “Coffee please”, Daniel replied. “As you wish”, the barkeep said dismissively. Anyone ordering coffee in his establishment hadn’t really understood what life was all about in his opinion.</Text>

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. The necessary settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle e-book.

How To Use This Template
Create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder. You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely). Instead, to create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.

Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Research” folders). You will choose different front matter depending on the format to which you are compiling.
Scrivener remembers your compile settings, so you only need to follow the instructions below when you want to compile to a different format. After that, you can just go to File &gt; Compile… and click the “Compile” button straight away.

To compile to standard manuscript format:
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information. (The &lt;$PROJECTTITLE&gt; and &lt;$fullname&gt; placeholders will be replaced during compile with the information you provide in the Project Properties tab of Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings…, or you can delete them and enter whatever text you like.)
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “Standard Manuscript Format” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” option is ticked and select the “Manuscript Format” folder from the menu button next to it (this is already selected by default).
Click “Compile”.

To compile to paperback PDF format:
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback Novel folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “Paperback Novel” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked and select the “Paperback Novel” folder from the menu button next to it if it is not already selected.
Click “Compile”.

To compile to e-book format:
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/E-Book folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image (the recommended size is 600x800 pixels, preferably in JPG or PNG format). You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “E-Book” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “E-book (with Parts)” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” option is ticked and select the “E-Book” folder from the menu button next to it if it is not already selected. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (This does not affect the cover image.)
If you have imported your own cover image, be sure to click “Cover” in the left sidebar and select the image from the “Cover Image” menu button.
From the “Compile for” menu button, choose whether to export to EPUB or Kindle format.
Click “Compile”.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be customised by going to Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings… and choosing the “Project Properties” tab.
Chapter subtitles: If you don’t want to include the names of your chapter folders below the chapter numbering text in the compiled document, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile dialog and deselect “Title” in the list of elements to include.
Page header and footer: You can edit the page header in the “Page Settings” pane of the Compile dialog.
Page size: The “Paperback Novel” format is set to export to a page size of 5.06” x 7.81”, which is one of the formats you can use with CreateSpace. You can customise this by clicking the menu button beside “Paper Size” in the “Page Settings” pane of Compile.
Font: You can use the “Formatting” pane in Compile to change the font used in the final document by selecting a row in the elements table, then clicking into the preview text to select it and clicking the “A” button in the format bar to change the font settings. Note that fonts are not included in e-books, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a particular font in an e-book).
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are really just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way, and you are free to create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, simply create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (whether by adding text, changing the title, setting default meta-data, or whatever). Now this document will be available as the basis of new documents from the New From Template menu. (You can add a custom icon to this if you so wish, too.)
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” document to use your chapter title and move it so that it is on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Move the “Chapter” folder to the Trash.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
In the “Separators” pane of the Compile dialog, change the “Text separator” setting to “Page break”.
If your scene separators are centred (for instance if you are using “#” as the scene separator) and you want them to appear centred in the compiled document, too, select them and choose Format &gt; Formatting &gt; Preserve Formatting.
Everything else: The above constitutes only the most common changes. You can completely change the output format by changing the various settings available in Compile.

Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Standard Manuscript Format”; “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback Novel” format; and “ADE E-book” shows the results when compiling to “E-book” format and opening the resulting EPUB file in Adobe Digital Editions on Windows.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template, and you can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

            <Title>Capital</Title>
            <Text>The Capital city of (simply called Capital) is one of the few places where the world seems to have fully recovered from the Event. The structure, being located on multiple shards, is quite different from cities before the Event, but in other senses it’s quite similar to a pre-Event city. It’s quite low in population (~10 000), but this is to ensure the level of wealth / comfort in the Capital can be kept. Besides some enclaves, it’s the only rich part under the control of #System 1#.

Where most of the world seems to be about survival, here it’s about life in it’s fullest. The idea of the Council-Controlled shards is that this ensures that culture survives even through the years following the Events, meaning humanity can bounce back quicker. Conveniently, the Council lives in the Capital.

It’s bustling streets make it seem like it has always been this way. Indeed, through careful reconstruction, a beautiful place has been created. It has an organic feel in structure, because the buildings, streets and other parts of the city don’t really line up often.
The basis of this city predates the Event. The buildings that were still standing after the Event were upgraded and kept in place. Some of them do not seem to be brought back to their full glory, but on the whole it has a finished look.

Life in the capital is like you would expect from a big city. It’s an eventful place, full of music, and other arts. You can see couples walk across the bridges of the city, walking nowhere, yet being where they want to be.

Each of these departments has their own Minister. 

The president + departments decide on policies. These need to either be voted through by the people, or by a majority in the top council. In this council, the President has four votes; the Ministers have one each.
The decision whether to do something democratically is decided upon based on what is deemed to be most tactful. Not all policy is made public, especially not outside the Capital.</Text>

Has had the same girlfriend for six years now. They haven’t married yet, because they were waiting for things to settle down a bit. They want to have kids, but haven’t come round to it yet. They do have a pet rat.

He feels like he has not really lived his life to it’s potential, and is sort of looking for something to break the mundanity of his life. Although he has everything he wants, he doesn’t feel like this is fulfilling to him.
So, he starts to look for stories in the numbers. To connect things that look like simple numbers to most. 
After he pokes a hole in the view of reality of the Capital, he wonders how deep the rabbit hole goes. How is it really going in the Outer Shards? Is the Capital being reasonable? …

            <Text>Daniel enjoyed his coffee while he waited in, having picked a comfortable chair in the back of the room. The regular guests didn’t seem to want to have contact with him, and frankly, he was fine with that. They didn’t really look like the sort of people that would enjoy talking about the subjects Daniel would enjoy talking about. The words he picked up seemed to be about sports. Daniel wasn’t a sports fan, not at all. Sure, he enjoyed playing a fun game of tennis, but he didn’t see why people would ever watch a sports. In his opinion, all the fun is gone when you’re not doing it yourself. So, instead of joining in the conversation about which sports team was gonna win, he just sat in a corner, enjoying his coffee.
He had just finished his coffee, when the barkeep signalled to him that he should come over. He did, and was told to exit the bar, and walk left. When he saw the house with the bright yellow door, he should knock on the door, four times. Then he should wait for someone to shout back, and knock two more times. Then he should say the Inn has the best beer. Daniel went on his way, and after a few minutes he found the house with the bright yellow door. It was the ugliest door he had ever seen. He knocked four times. Someone shouted: “Whatever you’re selling, we aren’t buying.”. Daniel knocked twice, and said: “The Inn on this shard has the best beer.”. He could hear a woman start giggling. It took her almost a minute to get herself sorted out, and then she opened the door. He was met by a woman who looked like she was just over thirty years old. “You do know that Bob was fooling with you when he told you to say that?”, she said. “What?, … oh…”, Daniel said, suddenly feeling quite stupid. “Anyway, my name is ##, “, she said, “and you are?”. Daniel introduced himself. “Ok, and why are you here?”, she asked. “I found a note somewhere, telling me to go there if I was the one who should go here.”, he said, trying to stay vague. She looked with mild distrust. “I had contact with someone who produces food for the Capital. He had sent a cry for help, saying they were starving.”, Daniel said. He continued to explain the process that had lead to him finding the house with the yellow door. “Ok, she said, I believe you. What do you want now?”, she asked. He answered that he hadn’t thought about that yet. He thought for a moment, and said: “I mostly want to know what’s going on. I have this strange itching feeling that something bad is going on, and that I’m kept out of the loop. I don’t know who is doing it, and why.”. “The Council; to stay in power”, she said. “Just answering the last two questions of yours, then we can focus on the first one. It’s hard to say what’s exactly going on, the Council has been keeping contact between the Capital and the Outer Shards at a historic minimum.”. “Something strange seems to be going on with the food supply. I work in the Ministry of Resource Planning, as a bookkeeper. We had problems with getting enough food. A few weeks after sending this message to the Ministry of Outer Shards, we suddenly got enough food again. Two weeks after that, I got the message about people who were starving. So, I guess there must be a pattern.”, Daniel said. She nodded, and said: “There’s a group of people here dedicated to figuring out what’s going on. We’re working on this every Thursday night. If you have time then, you can join.”. Daniel said that he didn’t know how his girlfriend would like that idea. She replied “You can’t tell your girlfriend. That’s too dangerous. So, if you decide to join us, you’ll have to find a reason for you to be absent on Thursday evenings and nights. Almost all of us have people around us that we have to lie to. It’s just an unfortunate consequence of how the Council is treating people who are just looking in the wrong spaces. Even that can be enough to land yourself over ten years in a forced work camp.”. “One thing I don’t get though,”, Daniel said, “Why William?”. “Because we feel that he was framed for a crime he didn’t commit.“, she answered. “You’re telling me he didn’t tell his organisation to attack that school?”, Daniel said. She answered: “Think about it, he would have known that that would do no good. It would only aid the Council.”. Daniel wasn’t too sure about it yet. But, to his own surprise, he didn’t instantly disregard that thought as being a silly theory by a crazy woman. Instead, he put it in his head to think about slowly, and come to a conclusion in his own time. 
Daniel suddenly realised it must have become quite late already, and said: “I think it’s about time for me to go. Where do I need to go if I want to come into contact again. She told him, just go to the Inn on a Thursday evening, and the rest will sort itself out. He said, “Thank you, see you around.”. She said goodbye, and left the door after he left the house. He hurried back home, and was happy to find out that he was home before his girlfriend. That meant that he was still on time. He turned on the radio, poured himself a glass of wine, and tried to relax. He had trouble doing so, because his mind was just full of thoughts. Twenty minutes later #name came home. She asked him how his day went. “Oh, same as always”, Daniel lied, “How was yours?”. She answered: “All right, we were told our new material would be good enough after some small improvements, so we can push forwards towards a release of a new album. I still prefer our previous, cancelled material, but at least we’re producing again.”. “That’s nice”, he answered. “By the way, shall we do rock-paper-scissors to see who should cook? I feel like cooking”, he continued. #name laughed. He played paper, she played scissors. Daniel laughed, and went to the kitchen area to start cooking. 

Daniel didn’t really have focus on his work the next day. Instead, he was thinking about how to combine being involved with the people of the Inn, while not destroying his relationship. He had found a lie that he thought was perfect. He would tell her he had found a group to work on his drinking habit. Among people who drank too much, he was far from the worst, but there were times when he was lucky to have her instead of someone else. And, with the idea of becoming a father slowly starting to materialise, the idea of fixing this problem would not be too much of a lie. Daniel felt terrible for telling this lie, but he went through with it regardless. It would allow him all the space he needed to work on himself.
So, next Thursday, Daniel went towards the Inn. He was greeted by the barkeep, who told him to go to the back room. He was met by three other people. #womanName was there again, as was a man, and an older woman. “You must be Daniel, I’m Violet. The grumpy-looking man over there is #name#. I believe you already met #womanName”, the older woman said. Daniel looked at the both of them. Violet looked around a lot younger than Daniel thought she would look. She had a strong but kind posture. The grumpy-looking man was much younger. Although his hair was showing signs of him getting older, it hadn’t turned grey yet. From his posture Daniel couldn’t guess much about his character, he seemed to be a bit of an enigma. “So you’re Violet, the one that was on the note. Still working as a journalist?”, Daniel asked. She said, “Part-time, yes. There’s no pensioning age in the Capital, you just get to work a bit less.”.
“Anyway, it’s probably best to first tell you what we’re doing here. But before that, I want you to know this is your last chance to step back from this. After this, you’re involved with us. It will make you an enemy of the state.”. Daniel said: “I was aware of that when I went here. Thanks for telling me though, it would have been bad to find out the hard way.”.
 She continued: “We should probably start by introducing ourselves. I’m Violet, part-time journalist. I was born in Londen, and was in my teens when the Event happened. I have had contact with members of The Voice of Reason in the past, a revolutionary organisation that was blamed for some terrorist attacks, until they had enough, and decided to attack the Capital and force the change.”. Obviously they had failed, Daniel thought, accidentally outloud. “True, which is still a shame, because their ideas were pure.”, Violet replied. #woman introduced herself as working as a teacher, and said she wanted to know for sure that she was teaching the children the truth. The enigmatic man said his name was Bob, and that he had his own personal reasons for joining. Daniel didn’t feel trusted by him yet. Ah well, he couldn’t really blame him.
 Violet said: “We’re a small group of people, working to make people aware of what’s going on outside their area. We don’t have a real political agenda, but we believe people have a right to know what’s going on. Without that, people cannot freely form their opinions. As you have noticed, the current way things work does not give people context of their work, and punished people who try to find out what’s going on in the world around them. Besides that, we have signs that people outside the Capital get treated as second-class citizens, basically slaves.”. Daniel said: “That could very well be true. I guess #womanName told you about the message that I found on one of the cargo receipts?”. Violet nodded. “There’s more hints than that. The problem is, it’s mostly all hints. We don’t really know what’s going on there.”, Violet said. “We need a mole in the government”, #grumpyGuy added, looking expectantly at Daniel. “You want me to infiltrate the government, and figure out what’s going on? I really don’t have the role within the government to get access to more information. I’d need to make career before I can effectively get more information. And that’s if I want to take that risk. I don’t know if I want to put my family in that position. ”, he said. Violet: “That’s to be understood. However, if you get into such a position, it would be extremely helpful if you at least passed on the information that you managed to collect. Even without taking big risks, just knowing what policies are in place can already give a lot of insight.”. Daniel thought for a moment; “I think there will be an evaluation #thing# in a month or two, I can express my wish to be promoted there. I think I’ve got a chance there. No promises though.”. #grumpyMan: “That would be very good news. We have some sources, but none within the department where you are working. So, your information could add new insights. Also, with the message you found, it’s obvious that something is going on, although none of our sources give any indication to that. This is not too unexpected though, the communication between the Capital and the Outer Shards is kept quite limited.”. When he returned home, his girlfriend was still waiting for him. He greeted her, and sat down next to her. He just barely resisted his urge to grab the bottle and pour himself a glass of wine. He thought: I’ll have to stop drinking now, anyway. He just hoped he would be able to stop on his own; it would be terrible if he would be unable to. She said: “If you don’t want to talk about it, it’s fine.”. Daniel said: “It went fine. I think I can do this.”. She smiled.

A month or so later, Daniel had an evaluation session. Charles and two others were present. After formalities, Charles started: “I first want to thank you for your diligent work, as well as your sharp thinking that lead to the discovery of the food shortage. You enabled us to evade a catastrophe. Therefore, we think it might be better to promote you to a position which allows you to do more of that sort of thinking. Just filling in forms seems to be a waste of your qualities. What do you think of this?”. Daniel answered without giving it even a second of thought: “Of course. I was quite sad to have to give up my research so others could work on it, so I would be happy to be moved to a spot where those skills are of more use.”. Charles: “In preparation of this conversation, I already asked around. It seems there are two spots available at the moment. One is in our own Ministry, as a Resource Planner. Your job there would be to analyse the data of incoming resources, and strategise what would be needed. You would work on resource curves, calculating the required stock levels for goods, and things like that. Alternatively, you could switch Ministries, and work at the Ministry of Outer Shards. Your task would then be more on getting the production levels themselves up to the level required. I think you would probably fit fine in either position, and you can probably get either position if you wanted it. The decision will be made higher up in the end, but if you have a preference, it will be taken into consideration.”. Daniel answered: “Can I think about it for a little bit, I’m not certain yet. Both seem to be fine positions, I’d like to think a bit on what I would prefer to be doing.”. Charles nodded, “Of course. If you think too long though, it will be chosen for you.”. After he saw that Daniel wasn’t reacting, he winked. Daniel smiled, and said: “I’m not sure if I would be really happy if I wasn’t working together with you, Charles. Both offers sound really good though. From what I heard, it seems I have to choose between doing something that’s an extension of my current job, and doing something new. On one hand, I think new things are probably more exciting, but on the other hand, I’m probably better at doing something more similar to my current job.”. Daniel was thinking about which job would give him more options. He decided the Ministry of Outer Shards would probably be a place to get more information about the shards themselves. “I think I would prefer the job at the other Ministry, if you don’t mind. I would miss you terribly though.”, he said. Charles said: “Anyway, I think we’ve just about finished this conversation, unless you have any questions.”. Daniel didn’t have any more questions, so they shook hands, and Daniel went back to his regular work spot.
Two weeks later, Daniel was told he would indeed get the opportunity to move jobs to the Ministry of Outer Shards. He moved offices a week later. The Ministry of Outer Shards was slightly less central than the Ministry of Resources. It was one of the later Ministries to be built, and basically only really took shape after the cable car system was connected. It’s current headquarters was on the same Shard as the initial cable car station. Symbolically, it was very close to the Outer Shards. In practice though, travelling by cable car required a permit, so the distance was enormous. Daniel entered the building. At his former job, the building was a retrofitted building from before the Event, this building was newly built after the cable car line was completed. It’s entrance hall was a beautiful thing, with large windows overseeing the cable car line. Daniel admired the view for some times, and then went to the administration desk. He said his name, and that he was there to start on his first day of work, as a production planner. The woman behind the desk went through her files, until she found one with his name on it. She got out an envelope with a letter in it. She said: “Read this, it should tell you quite a few things that you need to know right now.”. Daniel started reading. The note wished him welcome, and told him to get to the third floor, room 3-42. So, he did. The building had an elevator, but Daniel felt more like using the stairs. It was only three floors up anyway. He was greeted by .. And .., the same two persons that took over his research, who first went over the practical details of his job. His task would be to analyse the productivities of different Outer Shards, to see where problems may be, and how to solve them. Based on that data, he would be asked to advise on possible changes in requested goods per shard. For instance, if a shard is asked for mining, but their material is of low quality, they might be asked to instead do farming, or something else entirely. He asked: “So, how do I start? What’s a good point to work from?”. ## replied: “First we’ll introduce you to the rest of the team, they will then work you through what needs to be done, and what can be your part in the thing. We believe teams work better if they divide up the tasks among themselves, instead of telling people top-down what to do. They should be in the canteen in a bit, so you should probably just go there and grab a cup of coffee.”. Daniel nodded, and asked where it was. It was on the top floor, above the main entrance hall. It had an overview of both the main hall of the building, as well as of the cable car station outside. Daniel got himself a cup of coffee, and found a spot overlooking the cable car station. He didn’t have to wait long; two people walked towards him. They introduced themselves as Julia and Peter. They told me I was put on the advanced planning / prediction team. I would not be tasked as much with the day-to-day operations, but rather with the trends over the weeks, months, or years even. First, they wanted to get me up to speed on how the Outer Shards are managed. 
Basically, Daniel learnt, a lot of it came down to self-management. Some Shards were declared to be local political centres, and were made responsible of ensuring the Shards around them produced what was needed. This high degree of self-management was both a blessing and a curse. It meant that the Capital didn’t need to micro-manage too much, because the local management would control this. On the other hand, it also meant not all information made it to the top of the chain, sometimes making the image incomplete. As they were talking, smoke started to appear from the top of the cable car station. Even through the windows, screams could be heard. Then, suddenly, an explosion occurred. Parts of the roof of the station flew off. The loudness of the explosion shattered the windows around where Daniel, Julia and Peter were standing. By some miracle they didn’t get hurt. Then, seemingly in slow motion, one of the two cables started to loose tension. After a bit of time, it became clear that the end was no longer connected at this station, and that it was therefore now freely floating. The other station must have been as of yet unaware of the incident, therefore still pulling at the cable. Someone official-looking came by, and told them to stop looking and head to somewhere safe. They took one last look, and went away. 
At first, it wasn’t clear if it was an accident, or terrorism. The checks before people and cargo were let on-board the cable cars was quite strict; most people hadn’t even thought something like this would be possible. On both ends, passengers as well as cargo got scanned. Both passengers and cargo needed to have proper documentation before even being let on-board. This meant for people that they had to have a visum, signed by the Shard on the arriving side. In this case that would mean a visum for the Capital. Those were rarely given out to anyone not living in the Capital; the population of the Capital was large enough as it is. Also, transit capacity was really limited, so the cable cars really weren’t used for going on holiday or things like that. A week later, it leaked out that explosive residue was found at the site. This ruled out an accident, and meant that someone must have purposely planted a bomb. Either that, or a transport of explosives had gone wrong. Dangerous cargo was not regularly transported with this cable car though, the alternative, smaller system on the other side of the Capital was preferred for dangerous goods. That system lead to a less densely populated shard, so the dangers were smaller. However, it became clear that this secondary cable car route had been out of service for maintenance for the days leading up to the explosion. So, some reasoned, this might have been a transit of dangerous goods that was diverted through this route. 
In the mean time, Daniel and his new colleagues were instantly tasked with a difficult task: deciding which goods had priority, and how to route them so they could be brought to the Capital through the single remaining cable car link. With over seventy percent of the cargo capacity out of service, the regularly needed resources could not be brought in. It was decided instantly that anything non-vital would just be held up until the primary route was repaired. There were estimates that the repairs would take around two months to get the capacity back. There was an idea on how to do it, namely by having a small vehicle move over the cable. One end of the cable was still quite near the Capital’s cable car station, already tied back to the Shard. The other end though was freely floating in the space between the Shards. To solve this problem, it was decided to design and build a vehicle that could move up the single cable. After reaching the other station, it would hold the loose cable, and move back. It would only let go of as much of the loose cable as would be needed to move forward, always taking care to keep the cable under tension. This way the loose end of the cable could be brought back to the Capital, where it would be welded to the other end of the cable. After that, the cable loop would be back in operation. Repairing the station might take more work, but the system could work without a fully repaired station. 
After looking up which food was stored in the Capital, and how much would be needed, Daniel and his colleagues came to the conclusion that, mostly, fruit, vegetables and meat would be a problem. There was enough grain stored in the Capital to give people the required amount of food to survive, but they wouldn’t get much in terms of nutrients. Also, there was a matter of pride. The Council didn’t want people to eat just rice for two months. It would, symbolically, hurt the capital quite a bit to do so, showing that they were unable to fully care for their citizens. That’s why, besides the required types of food, some capacity was reserved for food that was small, but luxurious, such as chocolate. Also, toilet paper. They calculated the numbers for each resource, and planned the divertion routes per resource. Both cable car routes from the Capital went in quite different directions; the main one went to a more populated area than the secondary one. There were links available between the two that didn’t go through the capital, but the capacity of those was rather limited. Therefore, it was paramount to have a new planning that only used those links when it was really necessary. For instance, toilet paper was only made in two places in the Outer Shards, so that would need to be transported over those cross-links. As would be coffee and chocolate. Vegetables and meat would not all need to be transported like this, because these were more spread-out in production. It would just be a matter of getting enough from the limited number of shards in that area. It would be cutting it close, but it *should* still be possible, according to their calculations. So, they handed in their plans to their superiors, who were happy to see that there was indeed a good option.
Four weeks later, the repair vehicle took off over the single remaining cable. It was a modified passenger vehicle, built to slowly move on it’s own power. As a modified vehicle, it could still carry sixteen people; the slots were filled with both military personel and two government officials. The officials would be in charge of assessing the situation; the military personal would be in charge of ensuring the safety of the mission. Besides those people, the vehicle contained two technicians, who were in charge of seeing the mission through. In the end, ten soldiers, two officials and two technicians took off for this mission. The rest of the space was used for additional equipment, weapons and extra items that might be needed on the way. The journey would take more than twice the normal length, because the altered vehicle would not be able to run on full speed. Therefore, some of the space was also reserved for a better air system. The normal air scrubbers were made for a journey of up to sixteen hours. Normal journeys would take up to ten hours, so there was normally a decent margin. However, this journey would take thirty hours, easily. This was just fixed by placing three of the standard air-cleaners in the vehicle though, giving the people on-board a decent buffer in case things would go awry. It was assumed that they would be able to get new air scrubbers before heading back. The whole Capital waited in anticipation of good news. The mission was scheduled to take just over a week. Two days to get there, a few days to connect the cable, and four days back. The way back would take longer, but this was solved by having some people leave behind until the connection was restored. Even in the unlikely event where the cables weren’t restored, they could return by using the other cable car. It would take them over a week of travel, having to change vehicles multiple times, but it would be possible. And besides, if the link could not be restored, they might well be better off outside the Capital, where resources were probably less scarce.
After the vehicle had left vision range, the people in the Capital could do nothing but wait. 

Two weeks later, the vehicle came back into range, with a cable connected to it. So, it seemed that everything had gone as expected. However, when they got back, only two soldiers and one technician got out; the rest wasn’t in the vehicle. Instead, two unknown people had come out. They introduced themselves as being speakers for the people, and assured that the people who hadn’t returned were safe, for now. They were held hostage to force an open dialogue between the Capital and the Outer Shards. They had said that the Council was not willing to negotiate with them, because they were terrorists. When the cable car station had exploded, multiple people had died. To the people in the capital, there was no doubt, but that these terrorists should be taught a lesson. They can’t just go and destroy vital infrastructure. They can’t just kidnap people, and so on. In the meantime, the main cable car line was almost repaired, but in the current situation it probably still wouldn’t be of much use. 

Daniel went to the Inn again the next day (which was indeed a Thursday). He explained the others there what the situation at the cable car station was. His information was still quite incomplete, but it was more than anyone outside the Ministry knew. The others were quite shocked to hear of this. Violet: “This is not at all good. This will escalate, badly. People may have forgotten about the previous time something like this happened, or they have never been told about it. But the last time, the Capital showed off their power in a big way, causing lots of people to die. And this time, the rebels went much further. I sympathise with them, but they should have waited a bit longer. We could have helped them at some point. You «she was looking at Daniel» could have helped them.” “Me, I don’t know, really? I don’t have that much power in the Ministry.”. “Yet”, #NAME2 added. “With the current events that are going on, it should be easy for you to grow more important. This time around though, we have to take care to have proof. Last time we knew what was happening, but couldn’t do anything, because we couldn’t persuade the general population. Since the Ministry of Education is responsible for news production, news outside the government agenda doesn’t get published. So, it would be brilliant if you could, at some point, sneak out some documents that support our story, once we know what’s going on. ”. Daniel: “The problem is, the people in power are living on this side of the cable car lines, the people that are in trouble are living on the other side. There’s no real way to push evidence past this divide. So, how do we convince people that we are speaking the truth?”. Nobody had an answer yet.  Daniel said: “I suppose I’ll have to find a way to be able to get more control over the contact with the Other Shard. If I have someone at a central shard organisation who I can contact, then I might be able to get more information.”.

A strange normality started to manifest over the next couple of days.  The situation had not really changed, so people just went on with their lives. Then, he overheard a conversation in the background. They were talking about the prisoners, and that they had been specifically protected less perfectly. They had been able to escape. The idea was that they would get to their allies. Daniel overheard them mentioning the shard with the Inn. He walked away, and when he was properly out of sight, he started running. His legs were barely able to support him, he was running that fast. He managed to get to the Inn before the prisoners, because there were still people there. He looked at a surprised barkeep, who said: “Hey, what are you doing here, it’s not a Thursday.”. “I have to reach them, it’s important”, Daniel said. “I can ask Violet, I might know how to contact her. The others, I don’t know where they live. She might know, although she really shouldn’t. It was decided that it was safer that way. Just like I don’t know where any of you all live.”, answered the innkeep. Daniel nodded. “Can you look after my inn while I’m gone?”, the innkeeper asked Daniel. Daniel said he would. Fifteen minutes later, the innkeeper returned, with Violet. She looked really tired. “I think the others are still safe, they should only know about this place and my home. I’m known among the rebels, and this is a known rebel hotspot. The Government somehow hasn’t caught on yet, but  I frankly don’t even know why at this point. So, we should find a place safe to hide”. She looked expectantly at Daniel. ”My girlfriend doesn’t know about you two, so I can’t really hide you two here. Is there anywhere safe we can hide you two for now?”. The innkeep said: “well, there’s a cellar somewhere nearby that was half-collapsed. It looks like you can’t access it at all. So, as long as we don’t have people walking in and out of there all the time, we could hide there. Before going there though, we should collect some supplies.”. The barkeep said: “I’m gonna go to the backroom to get some food. Daniel, help yourself to whatever is here, Violet, please come with me to pick up things.”. Daniel grabbed a big bag that was still standing there, and filled it mostly with water bottles and some soft drinks. He also got some plastic cups, as well as some other miscellaneous items. He sighed, thinking. He put two bottles of whisky in the bag as well. Better have something to drink while down there, he thought, although he wouldn’t be the one staying down there. Violet and the Innkeeper returned, with two bags full of food supplies. They went on their way toward the cellar, looking around to see if strange figures were following them. They couldn’t see any yet, so they assumed they weren’t followed. With a bit of a detour, they walked towards the cellar. They took care to not disturb the surrounding flora, ensuring it looked like nobody went there. There wouldn’t really be a reason for people to go there anyway, so it wouldn’t need that much convincing. The place already had some blankets, still stored on a shelf. They were full of holes, and quite dusty, but after cleaning them up a bit, they could be used for now. The plan was not for them to stay here forever, but just to see out the storm. They weren’t sure about what to do after this yet. Daniel helped them settle in there, and went home. When passing near the inn, he could see that the Inn was surrounded by police officers. They must have found out about the hiding place, and attacked it. It was lucky that it wasn’t a Thursday, Daniel thought. Otherwise, the other two might have been caught. Daniel rushed back home, and met his girlfriend, who immediately got angry. She asked: “Where were you? You were suddenly missing from work, without reason. You got everyone worried that something had happened.”. Daniel said: “Oh, sorry. I felt really dizzy, and sat down somewhere in the fresh air.”. She looked at him with a look of not quite trusting him to speak the truth. He said: “I know, it sounds stupid, but I just felt terribly dizzy, like I could faint at any moment.”. “Have you started drinking again?”, she asked. “No…”, he answered. “Look, I wouldn’t mind if you di -” - “ I didn’t drink” - “ did, but you have to be honest, otherwise I can’t help you”. Daniel sighed. “I haven’t been drinking today, really.”. She looked puzzled. The adamant sincerity with which he said that must have confused her. “Then what have you been doing today?”; she was almost screaming. “I just walked around, because I was dizzy.”, he answered. She said nothing, he said nothing. After a while, he stood up and started cooking. 

The next Day, Daniel went to work again. He gave a simple lie: sorry, I was feeling ill, I know I should have asked the day off. Since his track record was decent, they weren’t asking further questions. They were long happy that he was already back only one day later; he had already made himself quite useful in the few weeks that he had worked there. His job now was mostly involved with figuring out what resources would become pressing first if the situation with the cable car was broken for longer. The secondary cable car system was already being upgraded, and would be of higher capacity in a couple of months. In the intermediate period, the main task was to prevent starvation. Besides that, they were looking into getting weapons and soldiers transported towards the Shard on the other end. The problem was, they had no idea how big the rebellion really was. If it was just a single shard, they could prepare the attack from elsewhere. The other ground station was still supplying to the Capital, so that Shard, and surrounded area seemed to still listen to the Capital somewhat. However, there was no indication which other shards were still listening to the Capital. The capacity of the cable car was limiting the transport to such an extent that the number of shards connected would not be a thing limiting the amount of cargo transported to the Capital. After some time, imports of things such as chocolate might start to dip, but this is hard to measure, until the dip is for longer, because the exact contents per-vehicle are decided on the Outer Shards, they just have to take care that the total amounts make sense, and that goods don’t get stalled for too long. If that happened, they could go stale, or the Capital could run out of them. 
A small vehicle arrived in the capital. It was too small to contain people, and just held a small glass container with a letter in it. It stated they would only accept surrender of the Council, a new democratic government, and a release of all political criminals. If this wouldn’t happen, the cable car would not be put back into service. No mention of the second cable car yet.  They must have thought it wouldn’t be enough to sustain the capital, anyway. 

The reasoning within the Ministry shifted. If this cable car connection is lost, which connection would be needed to keep the network stable? That was the question that was suddenly on the table. A new connection would take around six months to make, more if fewer Shards were cooperating. Still, it would be the only solution besides surrendering the government. And, this government would not surrender for some time. Besides that, the Council still had a set of gliders ready to attack if the time was really there. For now though, the council didn’t want to attack with those, because that would lead to a lot of damage and destruction. Still though, it was an option that was kept just in case.
A third cable car route option was pushed forward by the Council. It was given the highest priority besides the project of upgrading the secondary cable car line. The Council had become aware that the transport options really were their weak-point, and that having more than one main link was a necessity they couldn’t afford to skimp out on. It was decided that the third link would be a new biggest link. It would go into an area that was comparatively badly connected. The shards were already connected via other cable cars, but that required at least three links, and thus over twenty-five hours of just transit. Also, they were governed indirectly through two different local governments. Basically, at every stop on the cable car, there was a new local government. These would make decisions on what resources to push forward, and what they wanted per shard behind them. So, the further you are from the capital, the more layers of indirection are between you and the Capital. The project would start by surveying. They would fly around the shards in that region, looking for a nice big empty area to build a station. It would of course need to be facing the Capital to at least some extent. Quite conveniently, the Shards didn’t have relative rotation, which is why such a thing even works. After this, they would start construction. No shard has ever objected to a station being built, because it brings jobs, and power. They then become a hub within the tree-structure of power. So, after the surveys were completed, it was expected that construction could start pretty much immediately. Since the gravity wells of the Shards were rather weak, the cable car system actually wouldn’t need very heavy engines. Therefore, the only complex part of the system would be the cable itself, which would have to be produced at one of two special factories. One  of them was at the Capital, and it had started on building a cable for this route. The other factory was quite near Beta-One, so it was currently not of use, as long as the rebellion was going on. Actually, this route would use a double cable, to ensure a higher capacity could be reached. It would pretty much be a doubly built system; they really weren’t fucking around this time. The idea was basically that the current main route would be lowered in capacity to the point where it would be the least important route. Basically, this would be a punishment for going against the Capital; they would be much less important within the political landscape. 
It was decided that the cable car route would go to Octogon. Octogon was a medium-sized shard, and already had two small cable car connections. It contained a grain farm, as well as a small mill. It also had a small production of paper. Mostly though, it was conveniently located, and didn’t have a lot of population already. This meant the Capital could develop it in the way they pleased. Or at least, that was the plan. 
The first construction crew was not met with applause, but with demonstrations. It seemed the promise of an increase in political power would not be enough to keep this shard happy. They did not want the cable car there, and they would do what was in their power to stop it. The Capital had a hard time deciding what to do about this. On one hand, they didn’t want to give any out the message that open rebellion would ever work.

Daniel was drafted into a team to work on the third-cable-car situation. They were considering three different responses. One possibility would be to just switch to a different target Shard. This would be less ideal; Octogon was the ideal target for a third route, with ample of space, being nicely central within the cluster of shards in that region, and also already having two cable car connections. However, there were some alternatives that were of similar quality. This would mean the Capital would show that they gave up on something they had decided was the best option. Although, the reaction with respect to Octogon would not depend on the final location of the cable car station that much. The second alternative would be to go in with force, claiming Octogon, and building the station regardless. This would mean arresting the people in charge of the demonstrations there, and replacing them with people who were more likely to listen. This would be expensive, and was not in line with the current strategy of the Council. They would rather shy away from force. Using force against civilians was not seen as a way to get them to like you. It would create fear, but fear only gets people to listen to you for just enough not to get in trouble. It was seen as better to inspire than to frighten. 
The final option would be to do nothing, and just wait for them to come to their senses. This would involve using the soft power that the Capital had to persuade the people on Octogon into listening to the Council. It was decided to go for option three, while readying the option to build the station on a different Shard. There would be a marketing campaign there, stressing the importance of this new link. It would tell people of the increased job offers, economic growth, and how it would benefit everyone, both in the Capital, and in the Outer Shards. It would leave out -of course- how this would also break part of the bargaining chip the rebels had in Beta-One.
Daniel was asked if he wanted to join the team responsible for doing the promotion. He asked what it would entail. He was told that he would be tasked with producing a model of the cargo shipping patterns after the new cable car line was in-place, and how this would affect the local economy in Octogon, and around it. The idea was that by showing people what improvements would be made, they would be less likely to demonstrate. The leaders of the demonstration might never agree, it was thought, but if most other people do, the project can go through. This would mostly require that the work that was already done to choose for Octogon was presented in such a way that it was also clear to the people there what the benefits would be. It would also be of vital importance to showcase mostly the advantages for the Outer Shards, and to not put unnecessary emphasis on the benefits for the Capital. It should look like a win-win deal, even though the Capital would stand to win much more than Octogon would. Actually, being a nearby node for the shipping network is nice, but it’s a mixed blessing. It means you have more control, and stand to gain more wealth, but it also means the Capital will look more closely over your shoulder. The further away you are, the more indirectly you are managed. Basically, the outermost shards are very poor, but they are mostly free to do what they want, as long as they pay the required taxes.
After Daniel had finished his calculations, he was suddenly told that he was to head to the glider port tomorrow. He would be airlifted to Octogon to present the material there.  The idea was that by sending him, they would show that the Capital was willing to talk. The plan was to not send much military force with this time, because this might only be met with violence. The demonstrators on Octogon had shown no signs of being violent so far, and the Capital had no plans to escalate unnecessarily. Besides, it was assumed that the people on Octogon knew that doing anything to harm Daniel would not improve their situation.
Daniel said, sure, but then I’ll need the rest of the day off to prepare for leaving tomorrow. I promised my girlfriend that we would start preparing our wedding over the next couple of days, and I don’t want to break that promise. By leaving early, I can have my stuff packed before she comes home, and at least work a bit on preparing the wedding. The part about the fact that they were planning to get married wasn’t a lie. However, he was planning to go shopping, and to deliver that food at Violet and the Innkeeper. Doing so would mean that they would have enough food to last them a couple of days. They still had food for three more days, but he didn’t want to risk them having to leave there because he wasn’t back in time. When he entered the hideout, Violet and the Innkeeper looked surprised at him. “Back already?”, Violet asked. “I was asked to join a team to head to Octogon, one of the Outer Shards. It was planned to build a cable car line to there, but the people at Octogon were protesting it, threatening to block the construction. So, I’m getting sent there to convince them otherwise. I know, it’s incredibly dangerous, but it’s a great opportunity.”, Daniel said. Violet nodded. “Be safe.”. “I’ll try my best.”. Before going home, Daniel decided to walk via Violet’s place and the Inn. The Inn was was barred off with tape, showing clearly the government had been there. Violet’s place looked very much undisturbed. When he looked around for a bit, a neighbour of her said that she had been away for a while now. He asked if anything special had happened, the neighbour denied this. He decided he wouldn’t go back to visit Violet and the innkeeper today, and left to go home. 
His girlfriend was not too happy to hear about his planned adventure to Octogon. She said, “You should have refused.”. Daniel said: “They didn’t offer me a choice.”. She said nothing for a while. Daniel asked if something was wrong. “I’m pregnant”, she said, “I know, it’s not the right moment to tell you, but that’s what’s bothering me about this situation. I don’t want our child to have to grow up with only one parent.”. Daniel replied: “I’ll be safe.”, and gave her a hug, “I’ll be back before you know I’m gone, don’t worry.”.  She started to worry more.

The next day, Daniel went straight to the Glider Port. He was greeted by security staff, who, upon seeing his identification, immediately let him through, without bothering him with security procedures. He was let onto the tarmac, where he was greeted by the Minister of Outer Shards, who wished him good luck. The Minister wasn’t coming with though, the President had decided against this. Safety concerns were preventing the Minister from going. Daniel thought that he was probably seen as an acceptable risk, whereas the Minister wasn’t. This wasn’t the nicest thing to think about, but it was probably true. Besides that, Daniel thought they were right about that assessment; sending higher-up officials into a demonstration is a risk. The Ministry had planned for this to happen though, because it was thought that the symbolic value of sending such a high-placed official would outweigh the risks. The plan had been overruled by the President however. Daniel entered the Glider, and was explained the safety instructions. This didn’t take that long, because, in most cases, they would just die. There weren’t that many situations which weren’t normal, but didn’t result in an explosive death. Ok, missing the target would qualify, but that would result in drifting away, until they ran out of air. The gliders were unable to steer while outside the atmospheres of Shards, so they couldn’t be steered if they were misaligned.
They took off, and hurled themselves towards Octogon. Daniel thought it was incredible how such a machine could just fly. He had never left the Capital in his life, so this, for him, was the first time in between the Shards. He would get around forty minutes to enjoy the flight, before they were due to arrive in Octogon. There, he would get off, together with a few supporting staff. Looking out of the windows, Daniel saw the Capital quickly becoming smaller. He saw more Shards around than he had ever done before. In the distance ahead, nothing was visible yet. The cable car line to Octogon was going to be the longest line ever built within the Council-controlled shards. The regular travel time was scheduled to take eleven hours, making it one of the fastest of the systems. Still, Daniel was glad his flight would only take around forty minutes. Eleven hours, locked up in a cabin, no, he was happy to be in a glider instead. The main advantage of course was that the cable car could transport more, and at a fraction of the cost per kilogram. The glider could transport #COUNT# people, only a third of the capacity of the vehicles designed for the cable car. And that’s the passenger vehicles; the cargo vehicles were going to be even bigger. Still though, the tavel time would be a pain. 
They arrived in Octogon as expected. The landing was a bit bumpy, but nothing spectacular.
Daniel grabbed his bag, removed his seatbelt, and left the glider. There were multiple people surrounding the glider. Daniel said: “I mean no harm, I’m here to talk. The glider can leave at any moment if you want to.”. The fiercest-looking one asked: “Did you bring weapons?”. Daniel said: “No, I’m here just to talk.”. The one said: “Ok, tell your people to wait inside their vehicle, then we can go somewhere to talk. The name is Tom by the way.”. Daniel said: “I’m Daniel.”. They entered a small old-looking farm, and sat down at a round table. Tom asked: “So, what are you doing here? Wasn’t it clear that we didn’t want your plans?”. Daniel said: “Your reponse was quite clear. However, I feel like that maybe a better explanation of the plans could help.”. Tom replied: “You mean the plan: let’s get rich together. We would get more power, by allowing you to steal from our friends around us? You’re offering us to become slavedrivers instead of slaves, right?”. Daniel thought for a moment. Tom was telling the truth, but he didn’t really want to admit that. Daniel replied: “It would bring prosperity to this shard and the ones around.”. Tom interjected: “It would allow your people to push us down even harder. We might become more rich then, but we would lose a lot of our freedom. So, with all due respect, no thanks.”. Daniel asked: “What makes you want to stay independent so bad?”. Tom almost lost his calm. He breathed in and out a few times, and said: “You really don’t know? While you rich people were busy playing kings and queens, we here were battling starvation. And when we tried to protect our rights, we were kicked down. Are people in the Capital really that evil?”. Daniel replied: “No. They just don’t know about all of this. They get indoctrinated by the news, it seems.”. Tom: “You’re telling me they aren’t aware of the fact that the people outside the Capital are suffering? With the riches of the Capital, they must know, right?”. Daniel: “The Capital is built in such a way that people don’t see this problem. They don’t get to travel outside the Capital, don’t get to listen to people outside the Capital, and to pop this bubble, they would have to accept that they would have to lower their quality of living by quite a bit. So, they don’t want to see it.”. Tom asked: “You’re here now, right? What are you planning to do? Go back and continue living happily?”. Daniel: “They will never just accept me leaving the place. Neither do I really want to, I have a family there. If you know of a way for me to be of help, please say so though. Because currently I really don’t know how to be of help. I want to help, but currently, all it would give me is trouble at home.”. Tom thought for a moment. He said: “We really need people to start thinking. We need to find a way to show them, without any doubt, that they are not free, and that their riches are used to stop them from thinking. But how do you do that?”. Daniel said: “I don’t know. I do  know the Capital really doesn’t like it when people go against them.”. Tom got a bit annoyed at the lack of commitment of Daniel; “People are dieing here, while you’re living in your ivory tower. Anyway, we won’t accept a cable car station here, not without a fight. We’ve had it with your Capital, and have no interest in playing your game. So, the only question is: what now. How are you, Daniel, going to react to this. You could just go back, close your eyes, thinking you did an OK job, but just couldn’t really be of help. You could also try to do more. Maybe it would help if you stayed here longer. We could ask your ride to come back later. We could even request them to send someone with the actual power to do negociations. In exchange for democracy, freedom of travel, and journalistic freedom, we might be willing to reconsider.”. Daniel replied: “I don’t know how people will see it if I stay behind. With the hostage situation at Beta-One, I don’t know if they would be likely to listen. I could promote one of the neighbouring shards as a better option, but that would mean lying to my colleagues, who may well find out. That would ruin my reputation, and put me into grave danger. If no better option exists, that’s an option. That would not however help with the other goals you have.”. Tom replied, in a stern voice: “I’ve already come to a conclusion. You’re going to have to stay here until this has been figured out. We’ll pass along what we want, and that we want to talk to someone about it. Someone with actual power to make decisions.”. Daniel said: “You do know they will spin this as being a hostage situation; this will cost you your head.”. Tom said: “Maybe, but I don’t see a better option.”. Daniel: “Let me go back, then we can try to improve it from the inside out. Doing this now will lead to a full on war. A war you will never win.”. Tom looked sad and said: “It can’t always be about survival, sometimes it has to be about standing up for something. We’ve allowed survival to dominate our thoughts for too long, we have to think about our humanity as well. The current system cannot be permitted to continue, not under any circumstances. If the result is a war, the blood is not on my hands. It was the Council in the Capital that decided to do so. Oh, by the way, this message of war will be spread along the Outer Shards, so there will be a full-on war. The Capital may be able to kill a lot of people, but they will receive a lot of resistance. Don’t expect to get much food. You may well be better off here than in the Capital, anyway. At least here there’s food.”.

Daniel only knew about what happened in the days after this indirectly. He saw the Glider return, after which the government sent multiple gliders. In the meantime however, the people on Octogon had evacuated using one of the cable cars from there. It was as though Octogon had never existed. It was an empty shard with two cable car stations. Well, two, zero.. Fire bombs were set up, that could be remotely triggered. The trigger mechanism was triggered by running the cable in reverse. This would move something that caused a spark, which in turn set the entire buildings ablaze. So, Octogon was worthless from the perspective of a transit hub. Since they were unable to find out where the rebels had gone, they decided to go back to the Capital. From there, they got new instructions: take in anyone who could have known anything about their location. Question them until they answer. But here was the interesting thing. The neighbouring shards of Octogon claimed nobody was working the cable car system. They had not seen anyone new there. And of course, nobody was manning the cable car stations that didn’t connect to anything. Being more than six hubs away from the Capital, they had very little in the way of administration. For now, the Council let this situation slide. They had more pressing matters at hand. The hostage situation still wasn’t resolved. Since Octogon now was now empty, they might as use that as a military base. After that, they could move a decently sized military force there, and start a war. The distance between Octogon and it’s neighbours was just under half a kilometre, so not that big of a deal. The Council wanted to show power. They knew the transit speeds would be quite low, and assumed that there would be people willing to tell them who was part of the rebellion. High priority had finding back Daniel, who would be able to tell them who was part of the rebellion.

From a nearby Shard, Daniel could see multiple gliders approach Octogon. They guessed a military force was coming. About an hour later, a loud bang could be heard. A canister of sorts had crashed into a nearby building. Upon inspecting it, they saw it contained a note. It said: “Give up the rebels, and we’ll show mercy. It seemed the Capital was underestimating the scale of the rebellion. You have two days to find them, and the third day we want to have them on the marketplace, by dawn.”. They had a discussion about it, and decided not to do it. Most of the regular population of the shard had already moved away, the few people still living there were actually all members of the rebellion. So, instead, they just hid, waiting for the soldiers to arrive. They weren’t stupid, and hid on the side opposite from Octogon, assuming whatever fired the canister would not be able to reach them there. When that day came, four gliders landed on the shard, and troops came out. They removed the engine from both cable car stations, sabotaging the breaks in such a way that the cable would not be able to run at all. Therefore, the rebels had become stuck on this shard, with no way to get out of this shard, or get resources. They were facing death by starvation, if they didn’t change their strategy. They could see the gliders had left, thinking they had finished their jobs. They didn’t care that much for Daniel it seemed, seeing him as spoils of war. Still, one victim as a price for solving a problem with rebels, not bad at all.  That is, had it been succesful. There were only fifteen people on this shard, which had enough farming to sustain those fifteen people. So, basically, they were imprisoned, but would not die there. At least, not in the nearby future. So, they set out to get the cable to run freely. It would not be enough to get full service, but it could be enough to slowly get across. The brakes were working with a big weight that was holding the breakshoe in place. This would bluntly put the cable into place. The soldiers had bent the hinge. But they were able to think of a repair. It would take weeks, if not months, but they had plenty of food, and plenty of time.
So, when gliders returned four weeks later, to see if they were ready to give in, to their surprise, they saw that the people on the shard seemed to be doing fine. Therefore, they decided enough was enough. They sifted through the entire shard, putting all the food on a big pile in the center of the city. Then they slowly but certainly airlifted it all out. After they were done, they left a note, saying: we’ll be here again tomorrow, after that, we won’t be for another three months. Your choice. We’re sorry about Daniel, but this has to stop. If you give us your leader, the rest will only get minor charges. 

They did the math, the food they had left would, with luck, last them two weeks. The fix to the cable car system would, take slightly more than that. Then suddenly it dawned on Daniel. “We’ve been trying to solve the wrong problem. There’s no need to fix the system. We just need to break the cable. After doing that, the other end can start pulling us in. We just have to hope they will do so. One vehicle on this line was able to transport fifteen people. So, they would be able to make a break for it like that. They waited for the gliders to do their last fly-by. WHen they saw the gliders properly headed towards the horizon, they started breaking the cable. The idea would be that almost everyone would be in the cabin, and that the last person would enter just before the cable snapped. They would close the doors as they left. The tension on the cable would automatically push them out of the station. Since the travel distance was only seven hundred meters, the other side would almost instantly see the cabin. They would probably assume something had happened, and try to reel it in. At least, that’s what Tom, Daniel and the others hoped. If the other shard did nothing, they would suffocate within hours. This system was not made for long distance travel, so the oxygen-systems were only made to last for seven hours;  the smallest size that was built for these systems. They would have probably been fitted with smaller ones, had they been available. They then realised that, after they left the atmosphere, a thing guided by the cable would be able to reach the other shard without problem. They built a small fireworks rocket out of gunpowder collected from ammo. Even though the Council tried to ban gun ownership of normal citizens, this was Octogon region; guns had existed there for some time before the Event, and the law hadn’t really fully moved into these regions yet. It were hunting rifles, not really suited for man-to-man combat, but it would do fine as material for rockets. The rockets were built in no time. One of them was tested, and worked as expected. So, they built a simple guiding vehicle. It was a piece of wood, holding six rockets. It held two metal canisters with notes in them. The notes said: we’re in the vehicle, on a loose end of the cable. Please get us home. Hope to see you soon. Sophia, one of the other rebels, said a prayer, and they set the plan to motion. It’s said no plan survives contact with the enemy. They were lucky that there was no enemy in sight; it went exactly as planned, and they arrived on the next shard. They were greeted immediately by multiple people. They were hailed as heroes. From there, lots of options existed. And, by this point, quite a few weapons were collected. It looked like the region was getting ready for a full on rebellion. They may have given up on Octogon and the neighbouring shards, but they hadn’t lost anyone or anything important. Also, their story gained them more and more followers. Besides the original twelve and Daniel (who by now was really a part of the revolution), twenty more people seemed willing to fight. So, fight they were going to. First though, they were treated to a nice meal. Any meal would have been nice after the rations of the last couple of days, but this meal was genuinly great. It had multiple courses, and was served in candle-light, with wine. They were told that this was a gift from everyone in the surrounding shards, for standing up for their rights. The message was passing through the entire Outer Shard region now, and people were starting to get the will to fight.

To really hurt the capital, the third link should also be broken. That was the idea that was in everyone’s head on #SHARDNAME#. It would be very much protected by now though, so that would be a hard to achieve goal. In the end, they decided to go for the three cable car stations connecting with this shard. Just hurting two of them would already hurt the Capital in a major way, but by taking all three, they would remove the Capital’s ability to get new goods. They realised that this would mean war. However, they didn’t see any other way. And besides this, in a full on war, the Capital would not have much of a chance at winning, since they were outnumbered by great amounts. Nobody had bothered to count, but over two hundred thousand people lived in the Outer Shards, whereas the population of the Capital was limited to around ten thousand. One could conclude that the Capital ruled by fear and indoctrination, not by actual power. At least, that was the conclusion of the rebellion. 


A few days later, a Glider arrived. They must have thought waiting a few months was not really wise, preferring to observe once in a while. It did a fly-over of the neighbouring shard of Octogon. It flew by the cable car station twice. They must have noticed the cable was missing. They flew straight to the next shard, and dropped a note there. It said: “In one week you’ll give us the rebels, or there will be war.”. So, Sophia said: “This is it? “. The others stayed silent. They were mentally preparing for the fight ahead. Nobody there was a fighter, few of them even had held a gun in their lives. There were some weapons available, but they were far weaker than whatever the Capital would throw at them. So, they would have to outsmart them. They were planning to lay in hiding, retreating after every attack. They reasoned they would be at an advantage, since they knew the terrain.
It was debated whether Daniel should be evacuated. In the end, it was decided against this. If the position was lost, it would probably be best if he moved back to the Capital anyway. This since he didn’t belong with the Rebels, his family was elsewhere. The people still on the shard that didn’t want or couldn’t fight moved elsewhere, and defensive positions were set up. There were sixteen people that stayed behind in the end. Fifteen rebels and Daniel. Daniel did not have a weapon with him, he would stay hidden until the conflict had ended. Four gliders flew over the shard, and landed in the middle of the central plaza. They waited for people to arrive for a bit, and when nobody did, they split up and moved through the city. Two of them met a trap that was put there by the rebels. They were stuck in a net, and then quickly killed by two rebels, who then fled the scene again. After this early victory, the rebels that saw this got filled with adrenalin. They hadn’t thought they would actually be able to kill trained soldiers, and suddenly they had. The reality of murder would only kick in later. One more soldier was caught by a trap. Since his squadron was walking in a different pattern, he couldn’t be killed off with a knife. He was therefore shot. The noise triggered the soldiers around to be aware of the fact that the rebels had guns, so they changed their strategy. Instead of just walking around, they were going from cover to cover, looking for enemies in every covered spot as well. The early advantage the rebels had had was therefore now limited. A bit later, Sophia and Daniel were hiding somewhere. She had been tasked with keeping track of where he was, he would simply try and not be killed. Suddenly, they found themselves surrounded at multiple sides. Sophia tried her best to them from the attacking force, but being outnumbered that badly she didn’t manage to keep them off for long. From the way they approached, Daniel could see they weren’t coming to take prisoners. In the spur of the moment he made a decision that would change his life. He grabbed a gun, and shot three of them. Sophia shot one more, and the last one ran away. Daniel hoped he hadn’t seen his face; otherwise his hopes of coming back to the Capital had disappeared. Sophia looked at him and said: “You weren’t supposed to do that. Now you’re no longer our prisoner; they don’t even want you back.”. Daniel said: “Sorry, I could hardly let them kill you.”. Sophia: “That was the plan, and you agreed to it.”. Daniel: “Sorry, I just couldn’t let you get killed. We should try to prevent them from escaping.”. They got up, and started following the guy. They remained hidden as well as they could. The escaped person had had quite a bit of headway before they started running after him, and they soon came to the conclusion that they had no idea where he went. So, they decided to head to the old church next to the market place. It had a back entrance, and had a vantage point over the entrances of the gliders. That would give them at least a chance to kill the soldier that had spotted Daniel. If they were then very lucky, the story hadn’t already spread. They got even more ambitious when they saw that the gliders were only guarded by three guards. They had turned off the gliders, so no simple and fast escape would be possible. Still though, it might help to kill them, and apply some brute force to the engines. They hid near the gliders, hoping they hadn’t been spotted. It seemed they had been, because the guards were laying down a defensive position. Therefore Sophia and Daniel decided to retreat, and go for their original plan to man the church. On the market-side of the church, it had two boarded-up windows. The boarding had been done long ago, and there was a hole in one of the two boardings, big enough to fit a gun through. It wouldn’t be enough for two, but one gun would still be nice. They had one rifle with them, and two revolvers, so they would be able to fire quite some bullets from relative safety. They waited there for some more time, until finally some soldiers returned. They looked injured, and were limbing towards the plane. Daniel recognised one of the two injured soldiers. He was the one who got away. He grabbed the weapon, not wanting to force Sophia to kill because of his decision. When he got near the glider, Daniel took aim, and fired a shot. He missed. As he missed, he suddenly felt an illness overcome him. It was as though he suddenly realised what he was doing. “Fuck, I’m killing people”, he said. Sophia tried grabbing the gun, saying : “Isn’t that the point. They would kill you otherwise.”. Daniel said: “That guy won’t, he’s injured. This is fucked up..”. Sophia said: “Yes, but if he survives, you will not be able to return to the Capital. Or at least, not for as long as the people in power there currently are in power.”. “So be it”, Daniel said. Tears were rolling over his face, as he felt he could never return home. He thought of his child, who he would probably never get to see. He thought of his girlfriend, who would never become his wife. Who would probably hate him for what he did. 

The gliders left, and the smoke started to settle on #Shard. There was a lot of destruction and death. After everyone had come to the conclusion that all the soldiers had left, they returned to their base of operation; an old farmhouse. They counted how many were there, four were missing. Two were confirmed dead, two weren’t found back. They decided to go looking for them, as well as for any wounded, surviving soldiers. They weren’t planning to just let them die. They may be running a rebellion, but they weren’t planning to just start killing people for no reason. Besides, they knew the military would come back at some point. They wouldn’t just accept defeat. 
They found the two rebels after some looking. They had bullet wounds in places you especially don’t want bullet wounds. One of the two looked like he might have a chance still, the other really didn’t look that way.

They burried the dead soldiers, and brought the dead rebels to the church. Meanwhile, they did what they could for the wounded. Afterwards, they held a meeting. They talked about their options. Daniel said: “We may have just won, but they will be back at some point. However, it might take some point, because they have another front; Beta-One. They probably only sent an advance force here to quickly deal with us. They must have assumed we were unarmed. That’s an assumption they won’t be making next time.”. Tom said: “This time we’ll have some of their rifles though, they left some of the weaponry with the dead. They really left in a hurry.”. Daniel said: “That’s because they had something they wanted to tell home.”. He stayed silent for a while, then sighed. “We were surrounded by five of them, and were getting overrun. In a spur of the moment, I picked up a gun, and killed three of them. Sophia killed the fourth one, but the fifth one got away. So, they may have wanted to send that message back home.”. Everyone stayed silent. Tom said: “You probably realised what this means.”. Daniel: “I can never go home.”. Tom said: “It’s a hollow thing, but I want to say it anyway: you’re welcome here.”. Daniel looked into the distance, not really paying attention to the situation at hand. After a while he got himself back a bit, and said: “Thank you. I didn’t mean to be mean, but it isn’t really the same as home here. But I guess this will be home now.”.

They held a service for those who had fallen. #x #y, #z. All of them had given everything for a case that had only just started to become serious. They sat down around a pyre, where they burned the dead. It was a beautiful ceremony, with friends of the fallen ones holding speeches. #DRAMA

The next day they spent on cleaning up the place, and readying it for battle. They were planning to fortify the market place, and add in metal scrap material on every big flat area. This would make it hard for gliders to land there. They then told the neighbouring shards to also prepare for an attack. They didn’t know for sure if they would be targeted again. The military might go for one of the neighbouring shards next, to lower their options to get resources and political allies. After this, they were in doubt. Partly they wanted to try to get to the operational cable car line, but this would mean a long travel, and risking being attacked or trapped in a cable car on every part of the way. If, at any point of the journey, they got stopped in the middle, they would run out of oxygen and die. And only one side of the cable car line would have to be locked, then the entire thing would just stall. So, they weren’t able to safely travel there. They decided in the end to move one shard further, leaving their home-shard looking like they prepared defenses there. They had sent the people who didn’t want to fight there previously, and had good relations with this shard. So, they felt like they could trust them not to fuck up the transport. They were able to all fit into one cable car, and did just that. A simple twenty-minute journey later they were in #ShardNAME4, which was part of a cluster of nearby shards. Seven shards were connected here, all by bridges. It looked pristine, with lots of water features, foresty parts, and beautifully rebuilt houses. It wasn’t on the same level as the Capital was, but still, it was pretty. The wood from the forest-shards must have helped with construction. Daniel learned that this shard was quite remote, but was able to be quite powerful and rich, because it had the only glass pane factory of the entire System. Besides that, they had their own food supplies, so they would be able to survive on their own. And, to top things off, they even had some weapons of their own. There had been a small gun club in this area, so they had quite a few guns. Not enough to stop a military if they really wanted to go there, but enough to at least cause some damage to such a force. The people there had been annoyed with the Capital’s stance for longer, believing there should be less difference based on where people lived. They felt like they were never taken seriously, even though they had also managed to rebuild their shards quite decently. Actually, their place probably was  the second most advanced place in the System, only behind the Capital. The thing that made this place even more amazing was something Daniel only figured out after spending a week there. There had been an anti-aircraft gun that was stored there. It wasn’t in perfect working condition, but they would try their best to fix it. It looked like it was of quite an old design, probably not able to fire more than a kilometer perhaps. This would still be enough to, after moving it, guard off all the major landing spots. And so it happened, they had an anti-glider gun standing ready, around twenty people, decently armed, enough food to last them a lifetime, and decent living environment. If it wasn’t for the war going on, Daniel could actually just settle down here. Oh, and if his girlfriend were to forgive him, and move here.

This place had everything, nice lush forests, beautiful lakes, and even a swimming pool. There was a garden filled with statues, </Text>

            <Text>Daniel is split between wanting to figure out what’s going on in the world, and wanting to live a normal life. He wants to start a family with his girlfriend, he wants to just focus on his work. After he pulls at a thread, he can’t stop pulling, thinking the rope will stop at some point. Instead, it seems to unroll all the way. 
While he does this, his relationships with everyone and everything deteriorates, especially the one with his wife.
In the end, he decides to tell her, and she tells the government that he has gone insane. They had a two-year-old child by this point, and she was terrified of her child being hurt because of his stupidity. And since he betrayed her anyway, she felt this was justified.

Second part of story (if first one doesn’t get there): either his child, or someone else, and told as the story of someone who sees the world fall apart. Mimics the first arc to a certain extent, but on a bigger scale.</Text>
