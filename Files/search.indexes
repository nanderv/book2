            <Text>Fifty-seven tonnes of grain he mumbled to himself. Not bad for this time of year. At the current price, that rated as ### New Pounds. Although the treasury will be unhappy, the people will be fed. Though bookkeeping is not a job for everyone, it probably is the right job for Daniel ... He had been doing this for six years now, ever since he left school.

He moved on to the next trade receipt. It listed cotton, although a very low amount. He sighed, and calculated the value nevertheless, not forgetting to subtract from it for it being a low quantity. It was a measly sum, but still, it should be paid for. The bookkeeping had to be kept perfect, or at least, it had to seem that way. He continued this process for the remaining receipts, carefully calculating the required payments. A knock on his door interrupted him, just as he was working on one of the last receipts of the day. “I’m coming”, he shouted, realising that he should have been at a meeting ten minutes before. Oops.. Of course, the weekly meeting for bulk goods bookkeepers, he thought. How could I have forgotten, there’s a meeting every Tuesday.
He quickly grabbed his notebook, and left his office. In the hallway, #name2 was waiting for him. “Sorry, I lost track of time”, he said. “It’s all-right. The others probably won’t even be there yet. ”, was the answer he got. They walked through the hallway to the main staircase. One floor down, they found the meeting room. It was a larger office, with a round table in it. Four people were already seated there, with the two entering this means a meeting of six people. Four of them, Daniel, ##, ## and ## were bookkeepers. Charles was overseeing the meeting, and Ellen was responsible for transcribing the meeting. 
Daniel loved the view from this room. A window overlooked the Monument, as well as two of the bridges connecting the Monument island. Especially in the late afternoon, when the light cast shadows over Monument island, it was a sight to behold. There was a mass of people flowing between the trees and statues on the island. Some people were standing still, admiring the music and art made by the people on the streets. From the meeting room, it looked almost more like an anthill than a central part in a city. 

“Let’s start”, Charles said, bringing Daniel back to the matters at hand. “Are there pressing matters to discuss before going through the list?”, Charles asked? #name3, usually silent, raised his hand a little. “Yes?”, Charles said. “Did anyone else get enough cotton? My supplies have been dwindling.”, #name3 stated. “Not me”, #name1 said, looking at the last two bookkeepers, “Anyone else?”. They shook their heads. “Do we have any indication on why this is the case?”, Charles asked. He continued: “We have to sort this out before the winter season starts, otherwise people will be freezing.”. “The cold weather of the last few months was blamed by my suppliers”, Daniel said, “It is probably the same everywhere.”. The other bookkeepers confirmed his statement. After thinking for a while, Charles asked: “Would it help to increase the price for cotton?”. “It will not, because they don’t have more cotton than this.”, said …. Charles asks if there are other options to leverage more cotton. “There are none”, Daniel said, “cotton that isn’t there will not magically appear.”. Charles said he would contact the Ministry of Outer Shards to see what could be done. The others nodded in agreement. 
They moved on to the regular agenda of the meeting. Besides the cotton, the other resources were going as expected. Grain and other food was doing very well this year. Construction materials were also up by a decent margin. It was really just the cotton that was lagging behind. 
After the meeting, Daniel finished his last two trade receipts. Then, he wrote a short daily report. After that, he had done what he needed to do and left work. It was halfway through autumn, and the leaves on the trees had turned from green to yellow and red. He crossed the Monument island on his way home. The weather was nice, and it was quite crowded there. 

He turned right, crossing over to the market district. The market district was even more of a maze than most of the rest of the Capital. There were stalls everywhere, randomly scattered around. There was only just enough space in between the stalls to walk around. Some market stalls were temporary, barely more than tables with a cloth roof; some other stalls were of more temporary nature. There was also one main street, with permanent shops. Daniel loved roaming here, looking for nice finds. As he was walking around, he remembered he wanted to buy some flowers. There was no special occasion, he just wanted to surprise his girlfriend. He walked randomly through the market until he found a flower stall that he liked. It had flowers in every color imaginable, and then some. He thought for a moment, and decided to …

Having bought flowers, he went home. It was a fifteen-minute walk, crossing two more bridges in-between. He lived together with his girlfriend in an apartment, on the fifth floor of a seven-floor building. The building looked a bit dilapidated compared to the rest of the capital, but it was still quite a decent place to live. This building was constructed before the Event, but recently renovated. They had tried to make it look nicer, by adding a bit of colour, and some art. However, there is only so much you can do with giant towers of concrete. Daniel entered the front door, and walked up the staircase. There was an elevator, but he didn’t fancy using it. It was a tiny elevator, and he was a little bit claustrophobic. He entered his home, hiding the flowers behind his back. The apartment was had a bathroom, a living room and two bedrooms. The kitchen was connected to the living room. Since they had currently only a need for one bedroom, the second one was used for storing things. Daniel entered the living room, and was greeted by the cat. His girlfriend was not home yet, she must have still been at work. 
Ah well, he thought, then I’ll need to hide the flowers for when she gets home. He put them in a vase, and hid them behind a couch. He looked at the clock; 17:00. He turned on the radio, got himself a glass of wine, and waited for his girlfriend to get home. He didn’t start cooking yet, because he didn’t know when she would be home. Her working hours were a bit irregular. A short hour later, she arrived, and sat down next to him. She looked tired, so he asked her how her day went. She answered: “It was tiring. We had presented some ideas for new music, but they were not accepted by our higher-ups. Apparently, our songs were too anti-government or something. No, I don’t get it either. But this means that we have to do all that work again.”. He answered: “That sounds terrible. Is there anything you can salvage from your work though?”. She sighed, “Not much, apparently the tone of the music is already the problem. Enough about my day though, how was yours?”. Daniel answered, “Well, it was fine. I almost forgot the meeting again though.”. He didn’t tell her that he needed to be reminded of it by a colleague of his. She laughed: “Working hard again?”. He nodded. While talking, he had sneakily grabbed for the flowers, and presented them to her: “Surprise!”. She was indeed surprised, and smiled. “So, now you’re expecting me to cook?”, she asked, still smiling. Daniel asked if she was offering to do so. She said: “What about rock-paper-scissors”. Daniel sighed. She always beat him at rock-paper-scissors. Yet, it’s still, in theory, a fair game, so he felt he had no option but to say yes. Daniel played rock, #girlfriend paper. Slowly, Daniel got up and started cooking. 

In the Capital, it was easy to forget that the world had almost ended forty years ago. Life had seemingly fully bounced back to it’s former glory. Sure, not everything was back, but people were living their lives again. Especially in the weekends this was easy to see. On Saturdays, people did shopping. Not just for the things they needed for survival, but also for things they wanted. They might buy some cassettes to listen to music, books, or other things. Also, on the Saturday night, a lot of entertainment was available. For Daniel and his girlfriend, Saturday often meant going to a concert. She often had to play, and he had no option but to be there as a guest. To people unaware of the structure of the Capital, it might seem strange that a musician is able to survive within such a small town, and few options for selling your music outside the Capital. This was true, but didn’t take into account that some artists were subsidised by the Council. The Council also saw it as their task to make sure some cultural progress was made. All they asked in exchange is to have some say in what gets made. This Saturday, #girlfriends band had been planning to showcase some of their new work, but now that that work was forbidden, they would have to rely on playing some of their older work. The crowd probably wouldn’t mind much. They were mostly there to enjoy the ambiance and the beer, and didn’t care as much about which band was playing. To #girlfriend however, it felt like her art was being limited. And, like most other artisan people, this didn’t go well with her. 
Her band decided however that it wasn’t wise to go against the hand that fed them, and, begrudgingly, they only played accepted material that Saturday. The crowd seemed to enjoy the night regardless of this fact. Daniel enjoyed seeing her play live, because, even when she was annoyed at not being able to play what she wanted, she still was having fun. 

On the next Tuesday, there was another meeting. The situation with the cotton had not been improved up to this point. They were told by Charles that the cotton problem was being worked on by higher up people, and that there should be a solution soon. Daniel asked what the solution was, but was told by Charles that this wasn’t told to him either. Daniel decided not to ask further questions, not expecting answers. He did have a bit of a strange feeling about it, and wasn’t sure what that was coming from. 
Two weeks later, the cotton production improved, just in time for the winter season. This meant the clothing factories could get working. There were a few clothing factories near the Capital, providing clothes and other cotton-products for the Capital and the nearby shards. This meant that the promise of new clothing was kept by the Capital. It may not have been the most world-shattering promise, but if the Capital said something, they would arrange that that would get done. It was this promise which allowed the Capital to grow to be the centre of this new nation, and breaking this promise could have lead to terrible consequences. Or at least, so had Daniel been told. 
The thing that intrigued Daniel was that the price of cotton hadn’t increased. He would have expected this to be true, but it wasn’t. The suppliers that used to provide little now provided more. He wasn’t able to figure out what had caused this change, and therefore it stuck in his head. 
When he came home on the day he saw the increase in cotton production, he was silent. He was mostly staring at the ceiling, trying to solve the mystery, but came up empty. When # asked what was wrong, he answered, “Something was bothering me at work, but that you probably won’t think much of it.”. She answered, “Tell me what it is, then I can tell you what I think about it.”. He sighed and explained the situation to her. After thinking about it for a moment she answered: “Well, maybe they found out that there was just a problem with the quality of the product. Or perhaps there was a problem with harvesting. Or maybe there was just a misunderstanding in how much was actually needed. Who knows? It’s mostly nice that it’s fixed.”. Daniel answered, “But why aren’t they just telling us what was wrong?” She answered, “Because they like their secrets. I don’t know why, but they just do.” Daniel looked at a point in the distance. Finally, he answered: “Maybe that’s the thing I have a problem with, secrets.” She answered again: “Aren’t you overdramaticizing a bit over a bunch of cotton? I mean, there’s plenty of problems in the world, sure. But I don’t see how this thing, however weird it may be, is a real problem.”. Daniel answered: “Perhaps you’re right.”. They were silent for a while. #girlfriend broke the silence, asking: “Who’s gonna cook? Rock Paper Scissors?”. Daniel said: “Sure, I don’t mind cooking again.”. Daniel played Scissors, #girlfriend played Rock. With a sigh, Daniel got up, and started cooking. #girlfriend got up, saying: “You know, it’s probably more fun if we just cook together. I just like winning.”. 

There was a separate section of the market, just for food. It was closer to the cargo terminals, because there are types of food that perish more quickly. The food part of the market was the most organised part. This meant that you could actually find what you were looking for there. In the rest of the marketplace, you would just walk until you found something that resembled the thing you were looking for. Finding the same shop twice pretty much required a deal with the devil to achieve. Besides this, almost everyone who visited the market ended their visit feeling like they found the thing they set out to find. It just required of it’s guests to be a bit free-thinking in what they were looking for. For instance, if you were looking for a present for a friend, the market could easily provide you with unique presents. If you were looking for one specific type of present, it could sometimes take you a long time to find it , if at all. Dennis was looking for his regular set of groceries. His girlfriend had given him a list, but after inspecting it, he came to the conclusion that it was just the regular list. Even in the relatively organised food market, there was still plenty of theatre going on. Salespeople were actively advocating their produce, The freshest fish, the greenest vegetables, everything was the very best possible product. That is, if you were to believe the salespeople. Of course, if you did believe them, you would end up paying double the actual price of the product, if not more. There were also stores with fixed prices, but these only offered non-perishable food. The fresh food was only sold by the shopkeepers at the stalls. Daniel had developed a feeling for where the shopkeepers would be that he would need. He did not fully know how the market was set up, but, over time, he had developed a feeling for where the shopkeepers should be that he likes to visit. For instance, there was a shopkeeper that sold fresh loafs of bread. His bread was of exactly the type that Daniel and # enjoyed eating. He even got a discount there for being a regular customer, so that was also something nice. With his discount, the price was about equal to what bread was going for in other stores, but it was ‘proper’ bread. He also picked up rice and pasta at the same store, and continued on. 

Nothing of much consequence happened in the weeks after the cotton-incident. Daniel hadn’t really given it much thought afterwards the day on which it happened. Instead, he happily focused on what he was good at: administration without mistakes. For a lot of people, a job like his would not work. His job was a small task within a bigger flow of tasks. He hadn’t even been fully explained what all the other people were doing; instead he was just given a broad outline of the process, and what his task was within the process. A short summary is that the Capital needs certain materials. To accommodate these needs, certain buy orders are placed. These buy orders are a form of taxation, although shards get money in return. They can’t refuse the orders though. Daniels task is to ensure that the shards get the proper compensation for the produce they made for the Capital. Others were responsible for deciding what needed to be produced, as well as what could be produced by each shard. This was the responsibility of another ministry in entirety though, so he knew even less about that. He had heard some things during meetings, but other than that, he was totally unaware of these processes. Although this did annoy him a little bit, he could see how this would increase efficiency across the organisation. And the Capital was all about doing things with maximum efficiency, be it bookkeeping, or be it art. 

When the winter season start, crop yields lower. This is natural. In the world before the Event, farming was season-bound, but since the Event, the differences between Summer and Winter have been smaller. Also, since there’s a lot more light at night now, plants grow quite a bit faster. Some plants that is, some others have serious issues with the lack of proper nighttime. Some farmers even resort to putting shelters over these plants at night, just so they still get a period of night. However, as autumn turned to winter, Daniel noticed the numbers were dropping more quickly than in the years before. When he had collected enough data, he decided to mention it on the next meeting. So, when asked if there were exceptional things, he took the word: “I don’t get nearly as much food as I should at this time of year.”. Charles interrupted, saying “it’s normal for the numbers to lower as winter approaches.”. Dennis answered, “Yes, I know. As I was about to say: they are lower than any of the last five years. I checked my notes. And it’s even quite significant. I think we should look into this.”. Charles asked the others if they had seen similar patterns, but they hadn’t thought to look into their historic data. Charles said: “Then I suggest Daniel and I look into that, after the meeting. There’s no point in discussing this further until we have fact.”. The rest agreed.The rest of the meeting wasn’t of much interest to Daniel, and he wasn’t really paying much attention. 
After the meeting, they moved to Charles’ office. It was similar to Daniel’s office, but a bit bigger, and with a superior view. Charles asked: “So, what do you want to do?”. Daniel said: “First I would like to collect all the historic data from the archive, and then compare it to the data from this year.”. “That will take a while”, Charles answered, obviously annoyed at the thought of spending much time on going through all those files. Daniel observed the annoyance, and stated: “I could work through it, and give you a summary if you want to. There’s no reason for both of us to have to go through it. I just need you to sign off that I’m permitted to take the documents from the archive, I’m not permitted to do so without your permission.”. “Of course. I’m not sure if that’s the wisest solution, I feel like I should be involved with this”, Charles said. “I just wanted to give you the option. When shall we begin working on it?”, Daniel said. Charles answered that he could go to the archive to pick up the required documents now, and that they could start working on it right away. “It’s not the kind of thing we should wait for long with, this could create huge problems”, Charles stated. “Then I’ll just finish what I was working on, and wait for you to return”, Daniel answered. He had preferred to work alone on it, because he preffered doing things like this on his own. It’s not that he hated to be around people, it’s just that he felt like the puzzle wasn’t as much fun if someone else gets to solve half of it. He finished the things he still needed to do that day, and waited for Charles to return. Since the archive was largely on paper, requesting old data back could take a while. In this case, they would want data back from up to six years ago. The only reason Daniel had been able to do it more quickly himself was that he still had his own personal summaries of the work he had done. His colleagues were less vigilant at their jobs, so they didn’t have such an archive, causing Charles to have to ask for all the data from the last years, after which Charles and Daniel would have to go through it by hand, and extract the required totals. 
Charles returned with multiple boxes of paperwork on a trolley. Daniel went to his office with him, and they started on putting the boxes in-order. They started with the data from last year. Indeed, last year seemed to have much more productivity than this year. One year does not make a pattern of course, but it was still a good starting point. We carefully wrote down the numbers, and continued to the previous year. At this speed, it would take us multiple days to complete, since we also had our regular tasks to complete. We were willing to stay later for the next couple of days to figure it out. 

Daniel’s girlfriend was less happy about this, “Why did you decide to work for extra hours, instead of arranging that you could do it during the regular hours”, she asked. Daniel’s thought for a moment, thinking of a strategic reply. Finally, he answered: “I know it sounds insane, but we would have never been permitted to do this research ourselves if we didn’t do it in overtime. And we didn’t want to push it off to someone else, because we wanted to know for ourselves.”. She asked him: “Why do you want to know so badly? There’s other people working on finding these things out, it isn’t your job to worry about those things.”. Daniel answered, “I’m sorry, I can’t help it, I just really want to work on this.”. She stayed silent. Daniel knew she didn’t like his choice, but he didn’t want to change it. He tried to think of a way to convince her, but couldn’t really find one. Instead, he said: “I know this is annoying for you, I’m sorry about that. It’s just really important for me to do this.”. She continued to say nothing.

The next day, Charles and Daniel met at 16:00, after both had finished their regular tasks. They worked through two more years, both years confirming Daniel’s earlier observation. Charles said: “I think we should report on this already. This is too important to wait for three more days with reporting it to the people that are above me. This could possibly be catastrophic even.”. Dennis agreed: “I don’t think there’s much doubt that there’s indeed something very wrong here, and that the food supply will be in trouble if no action is taken. When you report it though, can you try to arrange it so that I can stay a bit involved, or at least get back the results of the research?”. Charles confirmed that that would indeed be fair, and that he would see what he could do. In the meantime, while he relayed the information to his superiors, Daniel could continue working on it if he wanted, Charles said. So, Daniel continued working on it indeed. Though he didn’t find much additional information, he managed to complete one more year before Charles got back, with two other people. Daniel had seen those once or twice before, they were two layers of management above Charles, so three above Daniel. When they saw him still working on it, they asked for his attention. Daniel looked at Charles, who seemed to be annoyed. Bad news, Daniel thought. “Hello, I’m Bob, and she’s called …”, one of the two mysterious persons said. They were wearing …, and looked like they meant serious business. “We heard you’re working on some research into a possible problem with the food supply. Can you show us what you found?”. Daniel said “OK”, and showed them the evidence. They looked at each other, possibly surprised by the matter at hand. … took the word, stating: “Thank you for showing us. We heard from Charles that you want to continue working on this. Unfortunately, due to reasons beyond our control, we can’t accept that request. We also can’t tell you about the results of this project, state policy demands thus. We also request of you that you stop doing further research into this, we’ve got this. There’s no point in spending needless work on this. Regardless, thank you very much for your hard work, we are happy to have you working for us.”. Daniel was not at all happy about this, obviously. He asked her: “Is there nothing you can tell me about the next steps? I feel like something I worked on very hard is just taken out of my hands, without explanation.”. She apologised, but said there wasn’t anything they could do. Daniel said: Alright, in that case, you probably want the boxes now, right?”. She nodded. Daniel: “Just give me a moment, I’ll sort them for you. All the papers are currently laying here systematically, so it’s best if I just put them back in the correct order. It should only take a couple of minutes.”. Bob said: “Sure, we can wait. Take your time.”. Daniel carefully forgot to mention the summaries he still had in his personal notebook. He reasoned that if they don’t ask, he doesn’t have to give it. After taking the boxes, Bob and ## left again. Charles thanked Daniel for his work, and also left. Daniel decided to also go home, because there was no point in staying to do more work. 


For three more weeks, the food production continued to drop. Then, as though nothing had ever happened, it increased to normal levels. One by one the producing shards started to produce their regular amountsfor the time of year. In the first meeting after some of them had started to produce again, Daniel stated that the productivity had gone up. Charles confirmed: “The Ministry of Outer Shards indeed worked on it, and found a solution. They found a way to increase productivity back to the required levels. They were not open for further questions, stating it wasn’t necessary for us to know, so we don’t get to know it. And besides, the problem was solved, so it isn’t important.”. The rest of the team nodded, feeling certain that the system as it was in place was able to effectively solve problems. Reassured, they continued doing their jobs as usual.

Most people would have never noticed a tiny detail on one of the receipts. Daniel was not most people though. His colleagues didn’t really bother to read the entire documents, assuming it’s always gonna read the same anyway. However, upon close examination, Daniel saw that there was something strange about this specific one. At the edge of the document, there seemed to be tiny markings. Upon closer examination, they seemed to be letters. He got his magnifying glass, and started reading. It said, “This is too much, we’re starving.”. That was all it said, but it was more than enough. Daniel stared out of the window, trying to think of what to do with this. If he told his superiors, the person who wrote this would be found, and punished, severely. Hiding messages in official documents was something that was very much illegal. And this wasn’t just a ‘John says hi’; this was a cry for help. The problem was however that if he didn’t tell his superiors and this got found out about, he would get punished. It might not be the most severe punishment thinkable, because it would be his first digression, but it would not go without serious consequences nevertheless. Daniel was thinking about talking to someone about it, but decided against it. Charles would just send a message to his superiors, and he didn’t want his girlfriend to also take the hit if it got found out about. Besides, telling her was already breaking the rules to begin with. So, he concluded, it was up to him to decide on what happened about this. The easiest option would be to report it to his superiors. In that case, the person who wrote it would be found, and punished. This was in accordance with the law, but he felt that that would not be reasonable. Someone knew about this risk, and decided to send this message regardless. Therefore, it must have been important to them to send this. Either that, or the Council was testing their vigilance, and if they were able to spot such details. The second option was to ignore it, and forget that the message was ever received. This would mean that, probably, nothing would happen. Neither Daniel, nor whoever wrote this note would be in trouble. The third option was to do something with the message. This would mean Daniel could get into serious trouble for it. However, if there’s actually something going on that causes the people on the Outer Shards to send more food than they can miss, this might be the only fair option. Daniel decided he would think about it more. He decided to handle the document as regular, but to write down the information of this receipt, so he could contact them by replying to a later order. Since each person in the department handled a fixed set of shards, this would surely happen at some point in the not-too-far future. He decided not to tamper with the note on the document. This meant that there was a small chance that it could be found when it was archived, but it also meant that he wouldn’t be in trouble if someone was testing him. If he altered the document, it would show that he was aware of the note, and wanted to destroy it. He did feel sorry for the people on …, but didn’t see another option. He couldn’t really start a fight with one of his superiors about this, or demand an explanation from another Ministry. At least, not without knowing what was going on. He thought about taking this to the press, but decided against it. This had two reasons. Firstly, the press was owned by the government, so there was a huge risk of him being caught. Secondly, he had no proof, besides a note on a single document. A note he could have easily put there himself. 
So, he decided to just wait. A week later some farmers were arrested. They had started shipping anti-government texts with their food. The Council decided to make an example out of them, so their trial was done quite publicly, with the trial being broad-casted live on the television system. They were put on trial for treason, as most people seemed to be. During the trial, evidence was shown of them not doing work, instead demonstrating against something. The reasons they were demonstrating were blurred out, on purpose, to prevent their demonstration from having effect. ‘Don’t give them an audience’ is one of the mantras of the way the Council dealt with people who demonstrated against them. The verdict in the end was that they were guilty. They were sentenced to five years of forced labour on the mining shards. Besides high-profile political cases, the only punishments given were forced labour and the death penalty. The luxury of keeping people that didn’t do any work simply wasn’t possible in the #system. People without a possible purpose generally were looked down upon. People had moved on from actively killing people who weren’t able to be useful, but they still weren’t treated as full. The situation had improved a bit since there was a law put in place that Shards had to take care for the people that needed the care, and progress was apparently made. Though harsh, the reality of the world is that there are only very few resources to begin with, so to also have to share them with people who can’t be of any use is a luxery which is not really possible, unless they were seen as important. All Daniel knew was that disabled people, and other people who needed help were treated with respect on paper, but in practice, they were really seen as a lower caste of citizens. 
Daniel had a sour taste after the trial. There hadn’t been demonstrations that lead to arrests for five years now. Generally, the government tried to just keep the demonstrations local, because the expense of arresting people often wasn’t worth it. Contain and ignore was often seen as a better policy than to actively go after people. This meant, in Daniel’s opinion, that the Council probably was trying to send a message. To whom, and why he didn’t know. He guessed it may have had something to do with the message he received earlier. The council probably felt that they needed to tell people to stay in line, and that they didn’t accept people to refuse their orders. After giving it some deliberation, he decided to send a message back to the shard which had sent out the cry for help. He just felt like he needed to know what was going on. He got the feeling that he wasn’t told the whole truth, and that something was not right. After giving it some thought, he decided that the next time he would get the chance, he would write a message on the same spot where they had written the initial message. Just the matter of finding a way to write that small. He decided to practice writing letters at micro-scale, and figure out which letters he could write that small. Obviously, something like a ‘l’ is easier to write than a ‘r’ or ‘w’. Still, even with some letters being confused for other letters, the other side should be able to figure out the message, if chosen carefully. Daniel wanted to go for a message that was simple, clear, and not too incriminating if caught. He decided to go for ‘Can I help?’. Simple, and short enough to look like a smudge to the unsuspecting eye. After that, he finished his work, and went home. In the weeks that followed, Daniel forgot partly about the message he had sent back. Life slowly reverted back to normal. Everything at work became boring and predictable, and Daniel’s private life also started to settle down. They had been talking about getting a child for some time, and had decided that it was time to stop talking. 
Three months later, as Daniel had almost forgotten about what had happened, he received another message. ‘Find Violet .., Times yy-mm-dd’, it said. Daniel was confused, he knew nobody by the name of Violet. Times xx-yy also was quite vague. After thinking about it for a while, Daniel thought it probably referred to a certain issue of the Times newspaper. Yy was then the year, with dd the week number. Daniel recognised the year; it was a well known year, taught in every history class. It was the year terrorists had taken hostages in the television studio. This was his first direct clue. So, he needed to go to the newspaper archive in the Library, and figure out what it exactly said in that specific issue of the newspaper. The next day, after work, Daniel went to the Library. He entered the huge hall, filled with books, newspapers, and other documentation. It looked like it had already been an old building when the Event happened. It had been restored with love though, and was a sight to behold. The roof was at least twenty meters above the ground floor, and on the sides were two side-halls with multiple floors in them. All floors were overlooking the central hall. Daniel already knew where he had to go: east side-hall, second floor. That part of the library was filled with rows upon rows of boxes filed with newspapers. They were sorted by date, so it didn’t take too long to find the correct date. Mostly, the boxes were one box per week, sometimes one box per two weeks, but for this specific date, one box was just for this date. Daniel picked it up, and walked to a table nearby, a bit out of the regular walking paths. He started scanning through all the newspapers inside the box. There were quite a few with articles written by a Violet. He assumed that was the Violet that the message talked about. He couldn’t really make sense of the hint though. Although he found a Violet, he didn’t know how it helped to know of a specific journalist that wrote articles #years# ago. Then he saw that in one of the articles it was mentioned that she was the journalist famous for interviewing William. William, who had been the leader of the Voice of Reason for a while. The Voice had been a terrorist organisation that, for a while, had some successes. At some point, William, their leader, had been caught, and put to trial. Before this trial, Violet had been tasked with trying to figure out what motivated him, to see if he had a chance to better himself. From these interviews, it became obvious that he couldn’t be changed, and he was put to death. Daniel had heard of this before, and seeing the name caused him to remember this. He also remembered that there was a shrine to William on the Monument Island. In the Capital, it was quite normal to build shrines to fallen enemies. This was done to show people that the Council was able to protect them, and that if they decided to revolt, they would regret it. 
Daniel decided to head to Monument Island, to see if he could find more clues at William’s tomb. After crossing the bridge from the library to Monument Island, he looked for the part where the anti-heroes were buried. It was quite clear which part it was. The design of that part was much less positive and next to every tomb was a sign explaining what that person had done wrong. Daniel was one of the few people walking this corner of Monument Island. The few people that came there seemed to come there to take a stroll, and feel like they were taken care of. Where the other parts of Monument Island had flowers, and other beautiful things on the monuments, here they were all big and empty. It was obvious that it was designed to look imposing, not beautiful. 
There was no real order in how the monuments were placed, yet William’s one was easy to find. His one had been blown up by a terrorist a few years ago, and therefore had had to be rebuilt. Therefore, they decided to put it on such a spot that it was even more visible, and to show the people who still thought his ideals were good what the capital thought of them. Well, the ideals weren’t really the problem, it was the fact that they were unwilling to cooperate. The text near his tomb said that William was first responsible for major social unrest, because of spreading radical and unachievable ideas. But the thing he was convicted for in the end wasn’t his idea. The text said that his ideas wouldn’t have been grounds for the punishment he was given. Since William’s ideas weren’t becoming reality, he had decided that if it couldn’t be his way, he might as well just start destroying things. Therefore, he had told some of his people to attack a school with children in it. Daniel wondered why this was of significance to the person who sent him the messages. It hardly seemed to be someone to be associated with. Ah well, thought Daniel, time to observe the Tome itself to see if there’s something special about it. From it’s entrance, it had a staircase leading up. On both sides of the staircase was a wall with a statue on it. Two blindfolded characters holding scales were standing on top of the walls, one on either side. On the tomb itself, a date was carved; ##  - ## - ##. Daniel noted it down in a small notebook. He walked around the tomb, looking for something else he might have missed. On the back of the tomb, he found a small note. It read: “If you are the person who should read this, head to the xx Inn, and ask if the summer has ended yet.”. Obviously a code sentence, is what Daniel thought. He had seen this inn once before; his girlfriend had played there once, before she joined a band. He didn’t remember much from the place, except that it wasn’t too centrally located. From the light, he could see that it was starting to get a bit late, and went home. He would have to visit the Inn later. He didn’t want to have to explain to his girlfriend why he was any later than he already was. Currently he could still say that it was busy at work. It would be a lie, but if you’re 30 minutes after your regular time, it still would sound reasonable. If you’re late by three hours, of course, it wouldn’t. 
His girlfriend had already cooked dinner when he got home. She had only just finished cooking, so he obviously wasn’t that late. “Sorry I’m late, it was a busy day”, Daniel said. His girlfriend looked at him with an annoyed look, and sighed. Daniel didn’t know what to do about the situation. On one hand, he really loved her, but on the other hand, he didn’t know how she would react if he told her what was going on. And if he didn’t tell her, he would have to lie quite a bit to her, in order to get the time required to get the time to do what needed to be done. And it was not like he didn’t want to be with her. Daniel would much rather just spend his time with her, but he felt like he just had to figure out what was going on. He didn’t know why he felt like he had to, but he did. He decided to sleep on it for a night, and see if he could come up with a solution in the following days.
He decided in the end that the only thing he could think of was to ask for some time off at work. He asked Charles if he could go home early the day after. Charles said that if he arranged that his work would not lag behind more than a day, he could. Daniel agreed to this, so he could take the afternoon off. Daniel hadn’t taken more than a couple of days off in total, so Charles wasn’t hard on him with respect to off time. If Daniel asked for it, he must have a reason is what he probably thought. So, after working with a speed above is already decent normal pace, Daniel left the office around two. This gave him a couple of hours to visit the Inn. He knew it was in the lower living district. It wasn’t the nicest of areas, about as bad as it gets in the Capital. In summary, it was still quite decent. It would take Daniel a thirty-minute walk to get there. The Capital was working on a transit system, but it was far from being operational. There were ideas, both cable cars and monorails, but they were seen as too expensive, and lacking the required capacity. Also, the geography of the Capital doesn’t really lend itself for regular transit systems. It was a connected system of fourteen shards, interconnected by bridges. To get from one place to another, you would cross bridges and shards until you got there. From his work, Charles would move through three different shards before he got there. The bridges weren’t built to minimise travel distance, but instead were built to minimise the number of bridges needed. There were a few more bridges than were needed to minimally connect everything, but those were mostly in the centre of the Capital. So, most routes involved a lot of walking the wrong way to get to a Shard from where you could start going the correct way. However, most people travelled from the shards outside the centre  to head to the centre and back, so, for most travels, the bridge network was quite adequate. It’s just if you want to go from one non-central place to another non-central place that it can be very ineffective. 
Daniel needed to look quite a bit when he got to the shard on which the Inn should be. It had changed quite substantially since he last visited it; it got modernised quite a bit. It actually looked somewhat decent. As he remembered it, the Inn was in a side-street from the small plaza where the bridge connected. When he last visited this Shard, it only had one bridge connection. Now it had two. The shard that was connected from the shard with the Inn on wasn’t connected yet when he last visited. Daniel remembered that the Inn was quite close to the bridge on which he entered the Shard. So, he decided to just look around. After a while he found the Inn. It had a new sign, that’s why he hadn’t recognised it instantly. The note still mentioned the old name, but it was obvious that it was the same inn, since it was on the same location where the old one was. The person who wrote the note just wasn’t consciously aware of the name change yet. Daniel entered the door, and was greeted with a few looks of mild distrust. It must have been obvious to the regular guests that he wasn’t one of them, and they looked at him with distrusft. Daniel walked up to the barkeep, and said: “Hello, excuse me, can you tell me if summer has ended yet?”. The barkeep looked up in a bit of surprise, and said: “No, it hasn’t. In about an hour, maybe. Arrangements will have to be made. Beer?”. “Coffee please”, Daniel replied. “As you wish”, the barkeep said dismissively. Anyone ordering coffee in his establishment hadn’t really understood what life was all about in his opinion.</Text>

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. The necessary settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle e-book.

How To Use This Template
Create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder. You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely). Instead, to create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.

Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Research” folders). You will choose different front matter depending on the format to which you are compiling.
Scrivener remembers your compile settings, so you only need to follow the instructions below when you want to compile to a different format. After that, you can just go to File &gt; Compile… and click the “Compile” button straight away.

To compile to standard manuscript format:
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information. (The &lt;$PROJECTTITLE&gt; and &lt;$fullname&gt; placeholders will be replaced during compile with the information you provide in the Project Properties tab of Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings…, or you can delete them and enter whatever text you like.)
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “Standard Manuscript Format” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” option is ticked and select the “Manuscript Format” folder from the menu button next to it (this is already selected by default).
Click “Compile”.

To compile to paperback PDF format:
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback Novel folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “Paperback Novel” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked and select the “Paperback Novel” folder from the menu button next to it if it is not already selected.
Click “Compile”.

To compile to e-book format:
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/E-Book folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image (the recommended size is 600x800 pixels, preferably in JPG or PNG format). You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “E-Book” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “E-book (with Parts)” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” option is ticked and select the “E-Book” folder from the menu button next to it if it is not already selected. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (This does not affect the cover image.)
If you have imported your own cover image, be sure to click “Cover” in the left sidebar and select the image from the “Cover Image” menu button.
From the “Compile for” menu button, choose whether to export to EPUB or Kindle format.
Click “Compile”.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be customised by going to Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings… and choosing the “Project Properties” tab.
Chapter subtitles: If you don’t want to include the names of your chapter folders below the chapter numbering text in the compiled document, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile dialog and deselect “Title” in the list of elements to include.
Page header and footer: You can edit the page header in the “Page Settings” pane of the Compile dialog.
Page size: The “Paperback Novel” format is set to export to a page size of 5.06” x 7.81”, which is one of the formats you can use with CreateSpace. You can customise this by clicking the menu button beside “Paper Size” in the “Page Settings” pane of Compile.
Font: You can use the “Formatting” pane in Compile to change the font used in the final document by selecting a row in the elements table, then clicking into the preview text to select it and clicking the “A” button in the format bar to change the font settings. Note that fonts are not included in e-books, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a particular font in an e-book).
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are really just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way, and you are free to create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, simply create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (whether by adding text, changing the title, setting default meta-data, or whatever). Now this document will be available as the basis of new documents from the New From Template menu. (You can add a custom icon to this if you so wish, too.)
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” document to use your chapter title and move it so that it is on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Move the “Chapter” folder to the Trash.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
In the “Separators” pane of the Compile dialog, change the “Text separator” setting to “Page break”.
If your scene separators are centred (for instance if you are using “#” as the scene separator) and you want them to appear centred in the compiled document, too, select them and choose Format &gt; Formatting &gt; Preserve Formatting.
Everything else: The above constitutes only the most common changes. You can completely change the output format by changing the various settings available in Compile.

Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Standard Manuscript Format”; “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback Novel” format; and “ADE E-book” shows the results when compiling to “E-book” format and opening the resulting EPUB file in Adobe Digital Editions on Windows.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template, and you can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

            <Title>Capital</Title>
            <Text>The Capital city of (simply called Capital) is one of the few places where the world seems to have fully recovered from the Event. The structure, being located on multiple shards, is quite different from cities before the Event, but in other senses it’s quite similar to a pre-Event city. It’s quite low in population (~10 000), but this is to ensure the level of wealth / comfort in the Capital can be kept. Besides some enclaves, it’s the only rich part under the control of #System 1#.

Where most of the world seems to be about survival, here it’s about life in it’s fullest. The idea of the Council-Controlled shards is that this ensures that culture survives even through the years following the Events, meaning humanity can bounce back quicker. Conveniently, the Council lives in the Capital.

It’s bustling streets make it seem like it has always been this way. Indeed, through careful reconstruction, a beautiful place has been created. It has an organic feel in structure, because the buildings, streets and other parts of the city don’t really line up often.
The basis of this city predates the Event. The buildings that were still standing after the Event were upgraded and kept in place. Some of them do not seem to be brought back to their full glory, but on the whole it has a finished look.

Life in the capital is like you would expect from a big city. It’s an eventful place, full of music, and other arts. You can see couples walk across the bridges of the city, walking nowhere, yet being where they want to be.

At the top of the pyramid is the President.
They have five departments under their command, namely:
1. Legal

5. External affairs

Each of these departments has their own Minister. 

The president + departments decide on policies. These need to either be voted through by the people, or by a majority in the top council. In this council, the President has four votes; the Ministers have one each.
The decision whether to do something democratically is decided upon based on what is deemed to be most tactful. Not all policy is made public, especially not outside the Capital.</Text>

            <Text>Born in the Capital, 12 years after the Event. When Book2 starts, he/she works as a bookkeeper for the Ministery of Now and Immediate Future. Seen as a stable worker, admired for his precision.

Has had the same girlfriend for six years now. They haven’t married yet, because they were waiting for things to settle down a bit. They want to have kids, but haven’t come round to it yet. They do have a pet rat.

He feels like he has not really lived his life to it’s potential, and is sort of looking for something to break the mundanity of his life. Although he has everything he wants, he doesn’t feel like this is fulfilling to him.
So, he starts to look for stories in the numbers. To connect things that look like simple numbers to most. 
After he pokes a hole in the view of reality of the Capital, he wonders how deep the rabbit hole goes. How is it really going in the Outer Shards? Is the Capital being reasonable? …

            <Text>Daniel enjoyed his coffee while he waited in, having picked a comfortable chair in the back of the room. The regular guests didn’t seem to want to have contact with him, and frankly, he was fine with that. They didn’t really look like the sort of people that would enjoy talking about the subjects Daniel would enjoy talking about. The words he picked up seemed to be about sports. Daniel wasn’t a sports fan, not at all. Sure, he enjoyed playing a fun game of tennis, but he didn’t see why people would ever watch a sports. In his opinion, all the fun is gone when you’re not doing it yourself. So, instead of joining in the conversation about which sports team was gonna win, he just sat in a corner, enjoying his coffee.
He had just finished his coffee, when the barkeep signalled to him that he should come over. He did, and was told to exit the bar, and walk left. When he saw the house with the bright yellow door, he should knock on the door, four times. Then he should wait for someone to shout back, and knock two more times. Then he should say the Inn has the best beer. Daniel went on his way, and after a few minutes he found the house with the bright yellow door. It was the ugliest door he had ever seen. He knocked four times. Someone shouted: “Whatever you’re selling, we aren’t buying.”. Daniel knocked twice, and said: “The Inn on this shard has the best beer.”. He could hear a woman start giggling. It took her almost a minute to get herself sorted out, and then she opened the door. He was met by a woman who looked like she was just over thirty years old. “You do know that Bob was fooling with you when he told you to say that?”, she said. “What?, … oh…”, Daniel said, suddenly feeling quite stupid. “Anyway, my name is ##, “, she said, “and you are?”. Daniel introduced himself. “Ok, and why are you here?”, she asked. “I found a note somewhere, telling me to go there if I was the one who should go here.”, he said, trying to stay vague. She looked with mild distrust. “I had contact with someone who produces food for the Capital. He had sent a cry for help, saying they were starving.”, Daniel said. He continued to explain the process that had lead to him finding the house with the yellow door. “Ok, she said, I believe you. What do you want now?”, she asked. He answered that he hadn’t thought about that yet. He thought for a moment, and said: “I mostly want to know what’s going on. I have this strange itching feeling that something bad is going on, and that I’m kept out of the loop. I don’t know who is doing it, and why.”. “The Council; to stay in power”, she said. “Just answering the last two questions of yours, then we can focus on the first one. It’s hard to say what’s exactly going on, the Council has been keeping contact between the Capital and the Outer Shards at a historic minimum.”. “Something strange seems to be going on with the food supply. I work in the Ministry of Resource Planning, as a bookkeeper. We had problems with getting enough food. A few weeks after sending this message to the Ministry of Outer Shards, we suddenly got enough food again. Two weeks after that, I got the message about people who were starving. So, I guess there must be a pattern.”, Daniel said. She nodded, and said: “There’s a group of people here dedicated to figuring out what’s going on. We’re working on this every Thursday night. If you have time then, you can join.”. Daniel said that he didn’t know how his girlfriend would like that idea. She replied “You can’t tell your girlfriend. That’s too dangerous. So, if you decide to join us, you’ll have to find a reason for you to be absent on Thursday evenings and nights. Almost all of us have people around us that we have to lie to. It’s just an unfortunate consequence of how the Council is treating people who are just looking in the wrong spaces. Even that can be enough to land yourself over ten years in a forced work camp.”. “One thing I don’t get though,”, Daniel said, “Why William?”. “Because we feel that he was framed for a crime he didn’t commit.“, she answered. “You’re telling me he didn’t tell his organisation to attack that school?”, Daniel said. She answered: “Think about it, he would have known that that would do no good. It would only aid the Council.”. Daniel wasn’t too sure about it yet. But, to his own surprise, he didn’t instantly disregard that thought as being a silly theory by a crazy woman. Instead, he put it in his head to think about slowly, and come to a conclusion in his own time. 
Daniel suddenly realised it must have become quite late already, and said: “I think it’s about time for me to go. Where do I need to go if I want to come into contact again. She told him, just go to the Inn on a Thursday evening, and the rest will sort itself out. He said, “Thank you, see you around.”. She said goodbye, and left the door after he left the house. He hurried back home, and was happy to find out that he was home before his girlfriend. That meant that he was still on time. He turned on the radio, poured himself a glass of wine, and tried to relax. He had trouble doing so, because his mind was just full of thoughts. Twenty minutes later #name came home. She asked him how his day went. “Oh, same as always”, Daniel lied, “How was yours?”. She answered: “All right, we were told our new material would be good enough after some small improvements, so we can push forwards towards a release of a new album. I still prefer our previous, cancelled material, but at least we’re producing again.”. “That’s nice”, he answered. “By the way, shall we do rock-paper-scissors to see who should cook? I feel like cooking”, he continued. #name laughed. He played paper, she played scissors. Daniel laughed, and went to the kitchen area to start cooking. 

Daniel didn’t really have focus on his work the next day. Instead, he was thinking about how to combine being involved with the people of the Inn, while not destroying his relationship. He had found a lie that he thought was perfect. He would tell her he had found a group to work on his drinking habit. Among people who drank too much, he was far from the worst, but there were times when he was lucky to have her instead of someone else. And, with the idea of becoming a father slowly starting to materialise, the idea of fixing this problem would not be too much of a lie. Daniel felt terrible for telling this lie, but he went through with it regardless. It would allow him all the space he needed to work on himself.
So, next Thursday, Daniel went towards the Inn. He was greeted by the barkeep, who told him to go to the back room. He was met by three other people. #womanName was there again, as was a man, and an older woman. “You must be Daniel, I’m Violet. The grumpy-looking man over there is #name#. I believe you already met #womanName”, the older woman said. Daniel looked at the both of them. Violet looked around a lot younger than Daniel thought she would look. She had a strong but kind posture. The grumpy-looking man was much younger. Although his hair was showing signs of him getting older, it hadn’t turned grey yet. From his posture Daniel couldn’t guess much about his character, he seemed to be a bit of an enigma. “So you’re Violet, the one that was on the note. Still working as a journalist?”, Daniel asked. She said, “Part-time, yes. There’s no pensioning age in the Capital, you just get to work a bit less.”.
“Anyway, it’s probably best to first tell you what we’re doing here. But before that, I want you to know this is your last chance to step back from this. After this, you’re involved with us. It will make you an enemy of the state.”. Daniel said: “I was aware of that when I went here. Thanks for telling me though, it would have been bad to find out the hard way.”.
 She continued: “We should probably start by introducing ourselves. I’m Violet, part-time journalist. I was born in Londen, and was in my teens when the Event happened. I have had contact with members of The Voice of Reason in the past, a revolutionary organisation that was blamed for some terrorist attacks, until they had enough, and decided to attack the Capital and force the change.”. Obviously they had failed, Daniel thought, accidentally outloud. “True, which is still a shame, because their ideas were pure.”, Violet replied. #woman introduced herself as working as a teacher, and said she wanted to know for sure that she was teaching the children the truth. The enigmatic man said his name was Bob, and that he had his own personal reasons for joining. Daniel didn’t feel trusted by him yet. Ah well, he couldn’t really blame him.
 Violet said: “We’re a small group of people, working to make people aware of what’s going on outside their area. We don’t have a real political agenda, but we believe people have a right to know what’s going on. Without that, people cannot freely form their opinions. As you have noticed, the current way things work does not give people context of their work, and punished people who try to find out what’s going on in the world around them. Besides that, we have signs that people outside the Capital get treated as second-class citizens, basically slaves.”. Daniel said: “That could very well be true. I guess #womanName told you about the message that I found on one of the cargo receipts?”. Violet nodded. “There’s more hints than that. The problem is, it’s mostly all hints. We don’t really know what’s going on there.”, Violet said. “We need a mole in the government”, #grumpyGuy added, looking expectantly at Daniel. “You want me to infiltrate the government, and figure out what’s going on? I really don’t have the role within the government to get access to more information. I’d need to make career before I can effectively get more information. And that’s if I want to take that risk. I don’t know if I want to put my family in that position. ”, he said. Violet: “That’s to be understood. However, if you get into such a position, it would be extremely helpful if you at least passed on the information that you managed to collect. Even without taking big risks, just knowing what policies are in place can already give a lot of insight.”. Daniel thought for a moment; “I think there will be an evaluation #thing# in a month or two, I can express my wish to be promoted there. I think I’ve got a chance there. No promises though.”. #grumpyMan: “That would be very good news. We have some sources, but none within the department where you are working. So, your information could add new insights. Also, with the message you found, it’s obvious that something is going on, although none of our sources give any indication to that. This is not too unexpected though, the communication between the Capital and the Outer Shards is kept quite limited.”. When he returned home, his girlfriend was still waiting for him. He greeted her, and sat down next to her. He just barely resisted his urge to grab the bottle and pour himself a glass of wine. He thought: I’ll have to stop drinking now, anyway. He just hoped he would be able to stop on his own; it would be terrible if he would be unable to. She said: “If you don’t want to talk about it, it’s fine.”. Daniel said: “It went fine. I think I can do this.”. She smiled.

A month or so later, Daniel had an evaluation session. Charles and two others were present. After formalities, Charles started: “I first want to thank you for your diligent work, as well as your sharp thinking that lead to the discovery of the food shortage. You enabled us to evade a catastrophe. Therefore, we think it might be better to promote you to a position which allows you to do more of that sort of thinking. Just filling in forms seems to be a waste of your qualities. What do you think of this?”. Daniel answered without giving it even a second of thought: “Of course. I was quite sad to have to give up my research so others could work on it, so I would be happy to be moved to a spot where those skills are of more use.”. Charles: “In preparation of this conversation, I already asked around. It seems there are two spots available at the moment. One is in our own Ministry, as a Resource Planner. Your job there would be to analyse the data of incoming resources, and strategise what would be needed. You would work on resource curves, calculating the required stock levels for goods, and things like that. Alternatively, you could switch Ministries, and work at the Ministry of Outer Shards. Your task would then be more on getting the production levels themselves up to the level required. I think you would probably fit fine in either position, and you can probably get either position if you wanted it. The decision will be made higher up in the end, but if you have a preference, it will be taken into consideration.”. Daniel answered: “Can I think about it for a little bit, I’m not certain yet. Both seem to be fine positions, I’d like to think a bit on what I would prefer to be doing.”. Charles nodded, “Of course. If you think too long though, it will be chosen for you.”. After he saw that Daniel wasn’t reacting, he winked. Daniel smiled, and said: “I’m not sure if I would be really happy if I wasn’t working together with you, Charles. Both offers sound really good though. From what I heard, it seems I have to choose between doing something that’s an extension of my current job, and doing something new. On one hand, I think new things are probably more exciting, but on the other hand, I’m probably better at doing something more similar to my current job.”. Daniel was thinking about which job would give him more options. He decided the Ministry of Outer Shards would probably be a place to get more information about the shards themselves. “I think I would prefer the job at the other Ministry, if you don’t mind. I would miss you terribly though.”, he said. Charles said: “Anyway, I think we’ve just about finished this conversation, unless you have any questions.”. Daniel didn’t have any more questions, so they shook hands, and Daniel went back to his regular work spot.
Two weeks later, Daniel was told he would indeed get the opportunity to move jobs to the Ministry of Outer Shards. He moved offices a week later. The Ministry of Outer Shards was slightly less central than the Ministry of Resources. It was one of the later Ministries to be built, and basically only really took shape after the cable car system was connected. It’s current headquarters was on the same Shard as the initial cable car station. Symbolically, it was very close to the Outer Shards. In practice though, travelling by cable car required a permit, so the distance was enormous. Daniel entered the building. At his former job, the building was a retrofitted building from before the Event, this building was newly built after the cable car line was completed. It’s entrance hall was a beautiful thing, with large windows overseeing the cable car line. Daniel admired the view for some times, and then went to the administration desk. He said his name, and that he was there to start on his first day of work, as a production planner. The woman behind the desk went through her files, until she found one with his name on it. She got out an envelope with a letter in it. She said: “Read this, it should tell you quite a few things that you need to know right now.”. Daniel started reading. The note wished him welcome, and told him to get to the third floor, room 3-42. So, he did. The building had an elevator, but Daniel felt more like using the stairs. It was only three floors up anyway. He was greeted by .. And .., the same two persons that took over his research, who first went over the practical details of his job. His task would be to analyse the productivities of different Outer Shards, to see where problems may be, and how to solve them. Based on that data, he would be asked to advise on possible changes in requested goods per shard. For instance, if a shard is asked for mining, but their material is of low quality, they might be asked to instead do farming, or something else entirely. He asked: “So, how do I start? What’s a good point to work from?”. ## replied: “First we’ll introduce you to the rest of the team, they will then work you through what needs to be done, and what can be your part in the thing. We believe teams work better if they divide up the tasks among themselves, instead of telling people top-down what to do. They should be in the canteen in a bit, so you should probably just go there and grab a cup of coffee.”. Daniel nodded, and asked where it was. It was on the top floor, above the main entrance hall. It had an overview of both the main hall of the building, as well as of the cable car station outside. Daniel got himself a cup of coffee, and found a spot overlooking the cable car station. He didn’t have to wait long; two people walked towards him. They introduced themselves as Julia and Peter. They told me I was put on the advanced planning / prediction team. I would not be tasked as much with the day-to-day operations, but rather with the trends over the weeks, months, or years even. First, they wanted to get me up to speed on how the Outer Shards are managed. 
Basically, Daniel learnt, a lot of it came down to self-management. Some Shards were declared to be local political centres, and were made responsible of ensuring the Shards around them produced what was needed. This high degree of self-management was both a blessing and a curse. It meant that the Capital didn’t need to micro-manage too much, because the local management would control this. On the other hand, it also meant not all information made it to the top of the chain, sometimes making the image incomplete. As they were talking, smoke started to appear from the top of the cable car station. Even through the windows, screams could be heard. Then, suddenly, an explosion occurred. Parts of the roof of the station flew off. The loudness of the explosion shattered the windows around where Daniel, Julia and Peter were standing. By some miracle they didn’t get hurt. Then, seemingly in slow motion, one of the two cables started to loose tension. After a bit of time, it became clear that the end was no longer connected at this station, and that it was therefore now freely floating. The other station must have been as of yet unaware of the incident, therefore still pulling at the cable. Someone official-looking came by, and told them to stop looking and head to somewhere safe. They took one last look, and went away. 
At first, it wasn’t clear if it was an accident, or terrorism. The checks before people and cargo were let on-board the cable cars was quite strict; most people hadn’t even thought something like this would be possible. On both ends, passengers as well as cargo got scanned. Both passengers and cargo needed to have proper documentation before even being let on-board. This meant for people that they had to have a visum, signed by the Shard on the arriving side. In this case that would mean a visum for the Capital. Those were rarely given out to anyone not living in the Capital; the population of the Capital was large enough as it is. Also, transit capacity was really limited, so the cable cars really weren’t used for going on holiday or things like that. A week later, it leaked out that explosive residue was found at the site. This ruled out an accident, and meant that someone must have purposely planted a bomb. Either that, or a transport of explosives had gone wrong. Dangerous cargo was not regularly transported with this cable car though, the alternative, smaller system on the other side of the Capital was preferred for dangerous goods. That system lead to a less densely populated shard, so the dangers were smaller. However, it became clear that this secondary cable car route had been out of service for maintenance for the days leading up to the explosion. So, some reasoned, this might have been a transit of dangerous goods that was diverted through this route. 
In the mean time, Daniel and his new colleagues were instantly tasked with a difficult task: deciding which goods had priority, and how to route them so they could be brought to the Capital through the single remaining cable car link. With over seventy percent of the cargo capacity out of service, the regularly needed resources could not be brought in. It was decided instantly that anything non-vital would just be held up until the primary route was repaired. There were estimates that the repairs would take around two months to get the capacity back. There was an idea on how to do it, namely by having a small vehicle move over the cable. One end of the cable was still quite near the Capital’s cable car station, already tied back to the Shard. The other end though was freely floating in the space between the Shards. To solve this problem, it was decided to design and build a vehicle that could move up the single cable. After reaching the other station, it would hold the loose cable, and move back. It would only let go of as much of the loose cable as would be needed to move forward, always taking care to keep the cable under tension. This way the loose end of the cable could be brought back to the Capital, where it would be welded to the other end of the cable. After that, the cable loop would be back in operation. Repairing the station might take more work, but the system could work without a fully repaired station. 
After looking up which food was stored in the Capital, and how much would be needed, Daniel and his colleagues came to the conclusion that, mostly, fruit, vegetables and meat would be a problem. There was enough grain stored in the Capital to give people the required amount of food to survive, but they wouldn’t get much in terms of nutrients. Also, there was a matter of pride. The Council didn’t want people to eat just rice for two months. It would, symbolically, hurt the capital quite a bit to do so, showing that they were unable to fully care for their citizens. That’s why, besides the required types of food, some capacity was reserved for food that was small, but luxurious, such as chocolate. Also, toilet paper. They calculated the numbers for each resource, and planned the divertion routes per resource. Both cable car routes from the Capital went in quite different directions; the main one went to a more populated area than the secondary one. There were links available between the two that didn’t go through the capital, but the capacity of those was rather limited. Therefore, it was paramount to have a new planning that only used those links when it was really necessary. For instance, toilet paper was only made in two places in the Outer Shards, so that would need to be transported over those cross-links. As would be coffee and chocolate. Vegetables and meat would not all need to be transported like this, because these were more spread-out in production. It would just be a matter of getting enough from the limited number of shards in that area. It would be cutting it close, but it *should* still be possible, according to their calculations. So, they handed in their plans to their superiors, who were happy to see that there was indeed a good option.
Four weeks later, the repair vehicle took off over the single remaining cable. It was a modified passenger vehicle, built to slowly move on it’s own power. As a modified vehicle, it could still carry sixteen people; the slots were filled with both military personel and two government officials. The officials would be in charge of assessing the situation; the military personal would be in charge of ensuring the safety of the mission. Besides those people, the vehicle contained two technicians, who were in charge of seeing the mission through. In the end, ten soldiers, two officials and two technicians took off for this mission. The rest of the space was used for additional equipment, weapons and extra items that might be needed on the way. The journey would take more than twice the normal length, because the altered vehicle would not be able to run on full speed. Therefore, some of the space was also reserved for a better air system. The normal air scrubbers were made for a journey of up to sixteen hours. Normal journeys would take up to ten hours, so there was normally a decent margin. However, this journey would take thirty hours, easily. This was just fixed by placing three of the standard air-cleaners in the vehicle though, giving the people on-board a decent buffer in case things would go awry. It was assumed that they would be able to get new air scrubbers before heading back. The whole Capital waited in anticipation of good news. The mission was scheduled to take just over a week. Two days to get there, a few days to connect the cable, and four days back. The way back would take longer, but this was solved by having some people leave behind until the connection was restored. Even in the unlikely event where the cables weren’t restored, they could return by using the other cable car. It would take them over a week of travel, having to change vehicles multiple times, but it would be possible. And besides, if the link could not be restored, they might well be better off outside the Capital, where resources were probably less scarce.
After the vehicle had left vision range, the people in the Capital could do nothing but wait. 

Two weeks later, the vehicle came back into range, with a cable connected to it. So, it seemed that everything had gone as expected. However, when they got back, only two soldiers and one technician got out; the rest wasn’t in the vehicle. Instead, two unknown people had come out. They introduced themselves as being speakers for the people, and assured that the people who hadn’t returned were safe, for now. They were held hostage to force an open dialogue between the Capital and the Outer Shards. They had said that the Council was not willing to negotiate with them, because they were terrorists. When the cable car station had exploded, multiple people had died. To the people in the capital, there was no doubt, but that these terrorists should be taught a lesson. They can’t just go and destroy vital infrastructure. They can’t just kidnap people, and so on. In the meantime, the main cable car line was almost repaired, but in the current situation it probably still wouldn’t be of much use. 

Daniel went to the Inn again the next day (which was indeed a Thursday). He explained the others there what the situation at the cable car station was. His information was still quite incomplete, but it was more than anyone outside the Ministry knew. The others were quite shocked to hear of this. Violet: “This is not at all good. This will escalate, badly. People may have forgotten about the previous time something like this happened, or they have never been told about it. But the last time, the Capital showed off their power in a big way, causing lots of people to die. And this time, the rebels went much further. I sympathise with them, but they should have waited a bit longer. We could have helped them at some point. You «she was looking at Daniel» could have helped them.” “Me, I don’t know, really? I don’t have that much power in the Ministry.”. “Yet”, #NAME2 added. “With the current events that are going on, it should be easy for you to grow more important. This time around though, we have to take care to have proof. Last time we knew what was happening, but couldn’t do anything, because we couldn’t persuade the general population. Since the Ministry of Education is responsible for news production, news outside the government agenda doesn’t get published. So, it would be brilliant if you could, at some point, sneak out some documents that support our story, once we know what’s going on. ”. Daniel: “The problem is, the people in power are living on this side of the cable car lines, the people that are in trouble are living on the other side. There’s no real way to push evidence past this divide. So, how do we convince people that we are speaking the truth?”. Nobody had an answer yet.  Daniel said: “I suppose I’ll have to find a way to be able to get more control over the contact with the Other Shard. If I have someone at a central shard organisation who I can contact, then I might be able to get more information.”.

A strange normality started to manifest over the next couple of days.  The situation had not really changed, so people just went on with their lives. Then, he overheard a conversation in the background. They were talking about the prisoners, and that they had been specifically protected less perfectly. They had been able to escape. The idea was that they would get to their allies. Daniel overheard them mentioning the shard with the Inn. He walked away, and when he was properly out of sight, he started running. His legs were barely able to support him, he was running that fast. He managed to get to the Inn before the prisoners, because there were still people there. He looked at a surprised barkeep, who said: “Hey, what are you doing here, it’s not a Thursday.”. “I have to reach them, it’s important”, Daniel said. “I can ask Violet, I might know how to contact her. The others, I don’t know where they live. She might know, although she really shouldn’t. It was decided that it was safer that way. Just like I don’t know where any of you all live.”, answered the innkeep. Daniel nodded. “Can you look after my inn while I’m gone?”, the innkeeper asked Daniel. Daniel said he would. Fifteen minutes later, the innkeeper returned, with Violet. She looked really tired. “I think the others are still safe, they should only know about this place and my home. I’m known among the rebels, and this is a known rebel hotspot. The Government somehow hasn’t caught on yet, but  I frankly don’t even know why at this point. So, we should find a place safe to hide”. She looked expectantly at Daniel. ”My girlfriend doesn’t know about you two, so I can’t really hide you two here. Is there anywhere safe we can hide you two for now?”. The innkeep said: “well, there’s a cellar somewhere nearby that was half-collapsed. It looks like you can’t access it at all. So, as long as we don’t have people walking in and out of there all the time, we could hide there. Before going there though, we should collect some supplies.”. The barkeep said: “I’m gonna go to the backroom to get some food. Daniel, help yourself to whatever is here, Violet, please come with me to pick up things.”. Daniel grabbed a big bag that was still standing there, and filled it mostly with water bottles and some soft drinks. He also got some plastic cups, as well as some other miscellaneous items. He sighed, thinking. He put two bottles of whisky in the bag as well. Better have something to drink while down there, he thought, although he wouldn’t be the one staying down there. Violet and the Innkeeper returned, with two bags full of food supplies. They went on their way toward the cellar, looking around to see if strange figures were following them. They couldn’t see any yet, so they assumed they weren’t followed. With a bit of a detour, they walked towards the cellar. They took care to not disturb the surrounding flora, ensuring it looked like nobody went there. There wouldn’t really be a reason for people to go there anyway, so it wouldn’t need that much convincing. The place already had some blankets, still stored on a shelf. They were full of holes, and quite dusty, but after cleaning them up a bit, they could be used for now. The plan was not for them to stay here forever, but just to see out the storm. They weren’t sure about what to do after this yet. Daniel helped them settle in there, and went home. When passing near the inn, he could see that the Inn was surrounded by police officers. They must have found out about the hiding place, and attacked it. It was lucky that it wasn’t a Thursday, Daniel thought. Otherwise, the other two might have been caught. Daniel rushed back home, and met his girlfriend, who immediately got angry. She asked: “Where were you? You were suddenly missing from work, without reason. You got everyone worried that something had happened.”. Daniel said: “Oh, sorry. I felt really dizzy, and sat down somewhere in the fresh air.”. She looked at him with a look of not quite trusting him to speak the truth. He said: “I know, it sounds stupid, but I just felt terribly dizzy, like I could faint at any moment.”. “Have you started drinking again?”, she asked. “No…”, he answered. “Look, I wouldn’t mind if you di -” - “ I didn’t drink” - “ did, but you have to be honest, otherwise I can’t help you”. Daniel sighed. “I haven’t been drinking today, really.”. She looked puzzled. The adamant sincerity with which he said that must have confused her. “Then what have you been doing today?”; she was almost screaming. “I just walked around, because I was dizzy.”, he answered. She said nothing, he said nothing. After a while, he stood up and started cooking. 

The next Day, Daniel went to work again. He gave a simple lie: sorry, I was feeling ill, I know I should have asked the day off. Since his track record was decent, they weren’t asking further questions. They were long happy that he was already back only one day later; he had already made himself quite useful in the few weeks that he had worked there. His job now was mostly involved with figuring out what resources would become pressing first if the situation with the cable car was broken for longer. The secondary cable car system was already being upgraded, and would be of higher capacity in a couple of months. In the intermediate period, the main task was to prevent starvation. Besides that, they were looking into getting weapons and soldiers transported towards the Shard on the other end. The problem was, they had no idea how big the rebellion really was. If it was just a single shard, they could prepare the attack from elsewhere. The other ground station was still supplying to the Capital, so that Shard, and surrounded area seemed to still listen to the Capital somewhat. However, there was no indication which other shards were still listening to the Capital. The capacity of the cable car was limiting the transport to such an extent that the number of shards connected would not be a thing limiting the amount of cargo transported to the Capital. After some time, imports of things such as chocolate might start to dip, but this is hard to measure, until the dip is for longer, because the exact contents per-vehicle are decided on the Outer Shards, they just have to take care that the total amounts make sense, and that goods don’t get stalled for too long. If that happened, they could go stale, or the Capital could run out of them. 
A small vehicle arrived in the capital. It was too small to contain people, and just held a small glass container with a letter in it. It stated they would only accept surrender of the Council, a new democratic government, and a release of all political criminals. If this wouldn’t happen, the cable car would not be put back into service. No mention of the second cable car yet.  They must have thought it wouldn’t be enough to sustain the capital, anyway. 

The reasoning within the Ministry shifted. If this cable car connection is lost, which connection would be needed to keep the network stable? That was the question that was suddenly on the table. A new connection would take around six months to make, more if fewer Shards were cooperating. Still, it would be the only solution besides surrendering the government. And, this government would not surrender for some time. Besides that, the Council still had a set of gliders ready to attack if the time was really there. For now though, the council didn’t want to attack with those, because that would lead to a lot of damage and destruction. Still though, it was an option that was kept just in case.
A third cable car route option was pushed forward by the Council. It was given the highest priority besides the project of upgrading the secondary cable car line. The Council had become aware that the transport options really were their weak-point, and that having more than one main link was a necessity they couldn’t afford to skimp out on. It was decided that the third link would be a new biggest link. It would go into an area that was comparatively badly connected. The shards were already connected via other cable cars, but that required at least three links, and thus over twenty-five hours of just transit. Also, they were governed indirectly through two different local governments. Basically, at every stop on the cable car, there was a new local government. These would make decisions on what resources to push forward, and what they wanted per shard behind them. So, the further you are from the capital, the more layers of indirection are between you and the Capital. The project would start by surveying. They would fly around the shards in that region, looking for a nice big empty area to build a station. It would of course need to be facing the Capital to at least some extent. Quite conveniently, the Shards didn’t have relative rotation, which is why such a thing even works. After this, they would start construction. No shard has ever objected to a station being built, because it brings jobs, and power. They then become a hub within the tree-structure of power. So, after the surveys were completed, it was expected that construction could start pretty much immediately. Since the gravity wells of the Shards were rather weak, the cable car system actually wouldn’t need very heavy engines. Therefore, the only complex part of the system would be the cable itself, which would have to be produced at one of two special factories. One  of them was at the Capital, and it had started on building a cable for this route. The other factory was quite near Beta-One, so it was currently not of use, as long as the rebellion was going on. Actually, this route would use a double cable, to ensure a higher capacity could be reached. It would pretty much be a doubly built system; they really weren’t fucking around this time. The idea was basically that the current main route would be lowered in capacity to the point where it would be the least important route. Basically, this would be a punishment for going against the Capital; they would be much less important within the political landscape. 
It was decided that the cable car route would go to Octogon. Octogon was a medium-sized shard, and already had two small cable car connections. It contained a grain farm, as well as a small mill. It also had a small production of paper. Mostly though, it was conveniently located, and didn’t have a lot of population already. This meant the Capital could develop it in the way they pleased. Or at least, that was the plan. 
The first construction crew was not met with applause, but with demonstrations. It seemed the promise of an increase in political power would not be enough to keep this shard happy. They did not want the cable car there, and they would do what was in their power to stop it. The Capital had a hard time deciding what to do about this. On one hand, they didn’t want to give any out the message that open rebellion would ever work.

Daniel was drafted into a team to work on the third-cable-car situation. They were considering three different responses. One possibility would be to just switch to a different target Shard. This would be less ideal; Octogon was the ideal target for a third route, with ample of space, being nicely central within the cluster of shards in that region, and also already having two cable car connections. However, there were some alternatives that were of similar quality. This would mean the Capital would show that they gave up on something they had decided was the best option. Although, the reaction with respect to Octogon would not depend on the final location of the cable car station that much. The second alternative would be to go in with force, claiming Octogon, and building the station regardless. This would mean arresting the people in charge of the demonstrations there, and replacing them with people who were more likely to listen. This would be expensive, and was not in line with the current strategy of the Council. They would rather shy away from force. Using force against civilians was not seen as a way to get them to like you. It would create fear, but fear only gets people to listen to you for just enough not to get in trouble. It was seen as better to inspire than to frighten. 
The final option would be to do nothing, and just wait for them to come to their senses. This would involve using the soft power that the Capital had to persuade the people on Octogon into listening to the Council. It was decided to go for option three, while readying the option to build the station on a different Shard. There would be a marketing campaign there, stressing the importance of this new link. It would tell people of the increased job offers, economic growth, and how it would benefit everyone, both in the Capital, and in the Outer Shards. It would leave out -of course- how this would also break part of the bargaining chip the rebels had in Beta-One.
Daniel was asked if he wanted to join the team responsible for doing the promotion. He asked what it would entail. He was told that he would be tasked with producing a model of the cargo shipping patterns after the new cable car line was in-place, and how this would affect the local economy in Octogon, and around it. The idea was that by showing people what improvements would be made, they would be less likely to demonstrate. The leaders of the demonstration might never agree, it was thought, but if most other people do, the project can go through. This would mostly require that the work that was already done to choose for Octogon was presented in such a way that it was also clear to the people there what the benefits would be. It would also be of vital importance to showcase mostly the advantages for the Outer Shards, and to not put unnecessary emphasis on the benefits for the Capital. It should look like a win-win deal, even though the Capital would stand to win much more than Octogon would. Actually, being a nearby node for the shipping network is nice, but it’s a mixed blessing. It means you have more control, and stand to gain more wealth, but it also means the Capital will look more closely over your shoulder. The further away you are, the more indirectly you are managed. Basically, the outermost shards are very poor, but they are mostly free to do what they want, as long as they pay the required taxes.
After Daniel had finished his calculations, he was suddenly told that he was to head to the glider port tomorrow. He would be airlifted to Octogon to present the material there.  The idea was that by sending him, they would show that the Capital was willing to talk. The plan was to not send much military force with this time, because this might only be met with violence. The demonstrators on Octogon had shown no signs of being violent so far, and the Capital had no plans to escalate unnecessarily. Besides, it was assumed that the people on Octogon knew that doing anything to harm Daniel would not improve their situation.
Daniel said, sure, but then I’ll need the rest of the day off to prepare for leaving tomorrow. I promised my girlfriend that we would start preparing our wedding over the next couple of days, and I don’t want to break that promise. By leaving early, I can have my stuff packed before she comes home, and at least work a bit on preparing the wedding. The part about the fact that they were planning to get married wasn’t a lie. However, he was planning to go shopping, and to deliver that food at Violet and the Innkeeper. Doing so would mean that they would have enough food to last them a couple of days. They still had food for three more days, but he didn’t want to risk them having to leave there because he wasn’t back in time. When he entered the hideout, Violet and the Innkeeper looked surprised at him. “Back already?”, Violet asked. “I was asked to join a team to head to Octogon, one of the Outer Shards. It was planned to build a cable car line to there, but the people at Octogon were protesting it, threatening to block the construction. So, I’m getting sent there to convince them otherwise. I know, it’s incredibly dangerous, but it’s a great opportunity.”, Daniel said. Violet nodded. “Be safe.”. “I’ll try my best.”. Before going home, Daniel decided to walk via Violet’s place and the Inn. The Inn was was barred off with tape, showing clearly the government had been there. Violet’s place looked very much undisturbed. When he looked around for a bit, a neighbour of her said that she had been away for a while now. He asked if anything special had happened, the neighbour denied this. He decided he wouldn’t go back to visit Violet and the innkeeper today, and left to go home. 
His girlfriend was not too happy to hear about his planned adventure to Octogon. She said, “You should have refused.”. Daniel said: “They didn’t offer me a choice.”. She said nothing for a while. Daniel asked if something was wrong. “I’m pregnant”, she said, “I know, it’s not the right moment to tell you, but that’s what’s bothering me about this situation. I don’t want our child to have to grow up with only one parent.”. Daniel replied: “I’ll be safe.”, and gave her a hug, “I’ll be back before you know I’m gone, don’t worry.”.  She started to worry more.

The next day, Daniel went straight to the Glider Port. He was greeted by security staff, who, upon seeing his identification, immediately let him through, without bothering him with security procedures. He was let onto the tarmac, where he was greeted by the Minister of Outer Shards, who wished him good luck. The Minister wasn’t coming with though, the President had decided against this. Safety concerns were preventing the Minister from going. Daniel thought that he was probably seen as an acceptable risk, whereas the Minister wasn’t. This wasn’t the nicest thing to think about, but it was probably true. Besides that, Daniel thought they were right about that assessment; sending higher-up officials into a demonstration is a risk. The Ministry had planned for this to happen though, because it was thought that the symbolic value of sending such a high-placed official would outweigh the risks. The plan had been overruled by the President however. Daniel entered the Glider, and was explained the safety instructions. This didn’t take that long, because, in most cases, they would just die. There weren’t that many situations which weren’t normal, but didn’t result in an explosive death. Ok, missing the target would qualify, but that would result in drifting away, until they ran out of air. The gliders were unable to steer while outside the atmospheres of Shards, so they couldn’t be steered if they were misaligned.
They took off, and hurled themselves towards Octogon. Daniel thought it was incredible how such a machine could just fly. He had never left the Capital in his life, so this, for him, was the first time in between the Shards. He would get around forty minutes to enjoy the flight, before they were due to arrive in Octogon. There, he would get off, together with a few supporting staff. Looking out of the windows, Daniel saw the Capital quickly becoming smaller. He saw more Shards around than he had ever done before. In the distance ahead, nothing was visible yet. The cable car line to Octogon was going to be the longest line ever built within the Council-controlled shards. The regular travel time was scheduled to take eleven hours, making it one of the fastest of the systems. Still, Daniel was glad his flight would only take around forty minutes. Eleven hours, locked up in a cabin, no, he was happy to be in a glider instead. The main advantage of course was that the cable car could transport more, and at a fraction of the cost per kilogram. The glider could transport #COUNT# people, only a third of the capacity of the vehicles designed for the cable car. And that’s the passenger vehicles; the cargo vehicles were going to be even bigger. Still though, the tavel time would be a pain. 
They arrived in Octogon as expected. The landing was a bit bumpy, but nothing spectacular.
Daniel grabbed his bag, removed his seatbelt, and left the glider. There were multiple people surrounding the glider. Daniel said: “I mean no harm, I’m here to talk. The glider can leave at any moment if you want to.”. The fiercest-looking one asked: “Did you bring weapons?”. Daniel said: “No, I’m here just to talk.”. The one said: “Ok, tell your people to wait inside their vehicle, then we can go somewhere to talk. The name is Tom by the way.”. Daniel said: “I’m Daniel.”. They entered a small old-looking farm, and sat down at a round table. Tom asked: “So, what are you doing here? Wasn’t it clear that we didn’t want your plans?”. Daniel said: “Your reponse was quite clear. However, I feel like that maybe a better explanation of the plans could help.”. Tom replied: “You mean the plan: let’s get rich together. We would get more power, by allowing you to steal from our friends around us? You’re offering us to become slavedrivers instead of slaves, right?”. Daniel thought for a moment. Tom was telling the truth, but he didn’t really want to admit that. Daniel replied: “It would bring prosperity to this shard and the ones around.”. Tom interjected: “It would allow your people to push us down even harder. We might become more rich then, but we would lose a lot of our freedom. So, with all due respect, no thanks.”. Daniel asked: “What makes you want to stay independent so bad?”. Tom almost lost his calm. He breathed in and out a few times, and said: “You really don’t know? While you rich people were busy playing kings and queens, we here were battling starvation. And when we tried to protect our rights, we were kicked down. Are people in the Capital really that evil?”. Daniel replied: “No. They just don’t know about all of this. They get indoctrinated by the news, it seems.”. Tom: “You’re telling me they aren’t aware of the fact that the people outside the Capital are suffering? With the riches of the Capital, they must know, right?”. Daniel: “The Capital is built in such a way that people don’t see this problem. They don’t get to travel outside the Capital, don’t get to listen to people outside the Capital, and to pop this bubble, they would have to accept that they would have to lower their quality of living by quite a bit. So, they don’t want to see it.”. Tom asked: “You’re here now, right? What are you planning to do? Go back and continue living happily?”. Daniel: “They will never just accept me leaving the place. Neither do I really want to, I have a family there. If you know of a way for me to be of help, please say so though. Because currently I really don’t know how to be of help. I want to help, but currently, all it would give me is trouble at home.”. Tom thought for a moment. He said: “We really need people to start thinking. We need to find a way to show them, without any doubt, that they are not free, and that their riches are used to stop them from thinking. But how do you do that?”. Daniel said: “I don’t know. I do  know the Capital really doesn’t like it when people go against them.”. Tom got a bit annoyed at the lack of commitment of Daniel; “People are dieing here, while you’re living in your ivory tower. Anyway, we won’t accept a cable car station here, not without a fight. We’ve had it with your Capital, and have no interest in playing your game. So, the only question is: what now. How are you, Daniel, going to react to this. You could just go back, close your eyes, thinking you did an OK job, but just couldn’t really be of help. You could also try to do more. Maybe it would help if you stayed here longer. We could ask your ride to come back later. We could even request them to send someone with the actual power to do negociations. In exchange for democracy, freedom of travel, and journalistic freedom, we might be willing to reconsider.”. Daniel replied: “I don’t know how people will see it if I stay behind. With the hostage situation at Beta-One, I don’t know if they would be likely to listen. I could promote one of the neighbouring shards as a better option, but that would mean lying to my colleagues, who may well find out. That would ruin my reputation, and put me into grave danger. If no better option exists, that’s an option. That would not however help with the other goals you have.”. Tom replied, in a stern voice: “I’ve already come to a conclusion. You’re going to have to stay here until this has been figured out. We’ll pass along what we want, and that we want to talk to someone about it. Someone with actual power to make decisions.”. Daniel said: “You do know they will spin this as being a hostage situation; this will cost you your head.”. Tom said: “Maybe, but I don’t see a better option.”. Daniel: “Let me go back, then we can try to improve it from the inside out. Doing this now will lead to a full on war. A war you will never win.”. Tom looked sad and said: “It can’t always be about survival, sometimes it has to be about standing up for something. We’ve allowed survival to dominate our thoughts for too long, we have to think about our humanity as well. The current system cannot be permitted to continue, not under any circumstances. If the result is a war, the blood is not on my hands. It was the Council in the Capital that decided to do so. Oh, by the way, this message of war will be spread along the Outer Shards, so there will be a full-on war. The Capital may be able to kill a lot of people, but they will receive a lot of resistance. Don’t expect to get much food. You may well be better off here than in the Capital, anyway. At least here there’s food.”.

Daniel only knew about what happened in the days after this indirectly. He saw the Glider return, after which the government sent multiple gliders. In the meantime however, the people on Octogon had evacuated using one of the cable cars from there. It was as though Octogon had never existed. It was an empty shard with two cable car stations. Well, two, zero.. Fire bombs were set up, that could be remotely triggered. The trigger mechanism was triggered by running the cable in reverse. This would move something that caused a spark, which in turn set the entire buildings ablaze. So, Octogon was worthless from the perspective of a transit hub. Since they were unable to find out where the rebels had gone, they decided to go back to the Capital. From there, they got new instructions: take in anyone who could have known anything about their location. Question them until they answer. But here was the interesting thing. The neighbouring shards of Octogon claimed nobody was working the cable car system. They had not seen anyone new there. And of course, nobody was manning the cable car stations that didn’t connect to anything. Being more than six hubs away from the Capital, they had very little in the way of administration. For now, the Council let this situation slide. They had more pressing matters at hand. The hostage situation still wasn’t resolved. Since Octogon now was now empty, they might as use that as a military base. After that, they could move a decently sized military force there, and start a war. The distance between Octogon and it’s neighbours was just under half a kilometre, so not that big of a deal. The Council wanted to show power. They knew the transit speeds would be quite low, and assumed that there would be people willing to tell them who was part of the rebellion. High priority had finding back Daniel, who would be able to tell them who was part of the rebellion.

From a nearby Shard, Daniel could see multiple gliders approach Octogon. They guessed a military force was coming. About an hour later, a loud bang could be heard. A canister of sorts had crashed into a nearby building. Upon inspecting it, they saw it contained a note. It said: “Give up the rebels, and we’ll show mercy. It seemed the Capital was underestimating the scale of the rebellion. You have two days to find them, and the third day we want to have them on the marketplace, by dawn.”. They had a discussion about it, and decided not to do it. Most of the regular population of the shard had already moved away, the few people still living there were actually all members of the rebellion. So, instead, they just hid, waiting for the soldiers to arrive. They weren’t stupid, and hid on the side opposite from Octogon, assuming whatever fired the canister would not be able to reach them there. When that day came, four gliders landed on the shard, and troops came out. They removed the engine from both cable car stations, sabotaging the breaks in such a way that the cable would not be able to run at all. Therefore, the rebels had become stuck on this shard, with no way to get out of this shard, or get resources. They were facing death by starvation, if they didn’t change their strategy. They could see the gliders had left, thinking they had finished their jobs. They didn’t care that much for Daniel it seemed, seeing him as spoils of war. Still, one victim as a price for solving a problem with rebels, not bad at all.  That is, had it been succesful. There were only fifteen people on this shard, which had enough farming to sustain those fifteen people. So, basically, they were imprisoned, but would not die there. At least, not in the nearby future. So, they set out to get the cable to run freely. It would not be enough to get full service, but it could be enough to slowly get across. The brakes were working with a big weight that was holding the breakshoe in place. This would bluntly put the cable into place. The soldiers had bent the hinge. But they were able to think of a repair. It would take weeks, if not months, but they had plenty of food, and plenty of time.
So, when gliders returned four weeks later, to see if they were ready to give in, to their surprise, they saw that the people on the shard seemed to be doing fine. Therefore, they decided enough was enough. They sifted through the entire shard, putting all the food on a big pile in the center of the city. Then they slowly but certainly airlifted it all out. After they were done, they left a note, saying: we’ll be here again tomorrow, after that, we won’t be for another three months. Your choice. We’re sorry about Daniel, but this has to stop. If you give us your leader, the rest will only get minor charges. 

They did the math, the food they had left would, with luck, last them two weeks. The fix to the cable car system would, take slightly more than that. Then suddenly it dawned on Daniel. “We’ve been trying to solve the wrong problem. There’s no need to fix the system. We just need to break the cable. After doing that, the other end can start pulling us in. We just have to hope they will do so. One vehicle on this line was able to transport fifteen people. So, they would be able to make a break for it like that. They waited for the gliders to do their last fly-by. WHen they saw the gliders properly headed towards the horizon, they started breaking the cable. The idea would be that almost everyone would be in the cabin, and that the last person would enter just before the cable snapped. They would close the doors as they left. The tension on the cable would automatically push them out of the station. Since the travel distance was only seven hundred meters, the other side would almost instantly see the cabin. They would probably assume something had happened, and try to reel it in. At least, that’s what Tom, Daniel and the others hoped. If the other shard did nothing, they would suffocate within hours. This system was not made for long distance travel, so the oxygen-systems were only made to last for seven hours;  the smallest size that was built for these systems. They would have probably been fitted with smaller ones, had they been available. They then realised that, after they left the atmosphere, a thing guided by the cable would be able to reach the other shard without problem. They built a small fireworks rocket out of gunpowder collected from ammo. Even though the Council tried to ban gun ownership of normal citizens, this was Octogon region; guns had existed there for some time before the Event, and the law hadn’t really fully moved into these regions yet. It were hunting rifles, not really suited for man-to-man combat, but it would do fine as material for rockets. The rockets were built in no time. One of them was tested, and worked as expected. So, they built a simple guiding vehicle. It was a piece of wood, holding six rockets. It held two metal canisters with notes in them. The notes said: we’re in the vehicle, on a loose end of the cable. Please get us home. Hope to see you soon. Sophia, one of the other rebels, said a prayer, and they set the plan to motion. It’s said no plan survives contact with the enemy. They were lucky that there was no enemy in sight; it went exactly as planned, and they arrived on the next shard. They were greeted immediately by multiple people. They were hailed as heroes. From there, lots of options existed. And, by this point, quite a few weapons were collected. It looked like the region was getting ready for a full on rebellion. They may have given up on Octogon and the neighbouring shards, but they hadn’t lost anyone or anything important. Also, their story gained them more and more followers. Besides the original twelve and Daniel (who by now was really a part of the revolution), twenty more people seemed willing to fight. So, fight they were going to. First though, they were treated to a nice meal. Any meal would have been nice after the rations of the last couple of days, but this meal was genuinly great. It had multiple courses, and was served in candle-light, with wine. They were told that this was a gift from everyone in the surrounding shards, for standing up for their rights. The message was passing through the entire Outer Shard region now, and people were starting to get the will to fight.

To really hurt the capital, the third link should also be broken. That was the idea that was in everyone’s head on #SHARDNAME#. It would be very much protected by now though, so that would be a hard to achieve goal. In the end, they decided to go for the three cable car stations connecting with this shard. Just hurting two of them would already hurt the Capital in a major way, but by taking all three, they would remove the Capital’s ability to get new goods. They realised that this would mean war. However, they didn’t see any other way. And besides this, in a full on war, the Capital would not have much of a chance at winning, since they were outnumbered by great amounts. Nobody had bothered to count, but over two hundred thousand people lived in the Outer Shards, whereas the population of the Capital was limited to around ten thousand. One could conclude that the Capital ruled by fear and indoctrination, not by actual power. At least, that was the conclusion of the rebellion. 


A few days later, a Glider arrived. They must have thought waiting a few months was not really wise, preferring to observe once in a while. It did a fly-over of the neighbouring shard of Octogon. It flew by the cable car station twice. They must have noticed the cable was missing. They flew straight to the next shard, and dropped a note there. It said: “In one week you’ll give us the rebels, or there will be war.”. So, Sophia said: “This is it? “. The others stayed silent. They were mentally preparing for the fight ahead. Nobody there was a fighter, few of them even had held a gun in their lives. There were some weapons available, but they were far weaker than whatever the Capital would throw at them. So, they would have to outsmart them. They were planning to lay in hiding, retreating after every attack. They reasoned they would be at an advantage, since they knew the terrain.
It was debated whether Daniel should be evacuated. In the end, it was decided against this. If the position was lost, it would probably be best if he moved back to the Capital anyway. This since he didn’t belong with the Rebels, his family was elsewhere. The people still on the shard that didn’t want or couldn’t fight moved elsewhere, and defensive positions were set up. There were sixteen people that stayed behind in the end. Fifteen rebels and Daniel. Daniel did not have a weapon with him, he would stay hidden until the conflict had ended. Four gliders flew over the shard, and landed in the middle of the central plaza. They waited for people to arrive for a bit, and when nobody did, they split up and moved through the city. Two of them met a trap that was put there by the rebels. They were stuck in a net, and then quickly killed by two rebels, who then fled the scene again. After this early victory, the rebels that saw this got filled with adrenalin. They hadn’t thought they would actually be able to kill trained soldiers, and suddenly they had. The reality of murder would only kick in later. One more soldier was caught by a trap. Since his squadron was walking in a different pattern, he couldn’t be killed off with a knife. He was therefore shot. The noise triggered the soldiers around to be aware of the fact that the rebels had guns, so they changed their strategy. Instead of just walking around, they were going from cover to cover, looking for enemies in every covered spot as well. The early advantage the rebels had had was therefore now limited. A bit later, Sophia and Daniel were hiding somewhere. She had been tasked with keeping track of where he was, he would simply try and not be killed. Suddenly, they found themselves surrounded at multiple sides. Sophia tried her best to them from the attacking force, but being outnumbered that badly she didn’t manage to keep them off for long. From the way they approached, Daniel could see they weren’t coming to take prisoners. In the spur of the moment he made a decision that would change his life. He grabbed a gun, and shot three of them. Sophia shot one more, and the last one ran away. Daniel hoped he hadn’t seen his face; otherwise his hopes of coming back to the Capital had disappeared. Sophia looked at him and said: “You weren’t supposed to do that. Now you’re no longer our prisoner; they don’t even want you back.”. Daniel said: “Sorry, I could hardly let them kill you.”. Sophia: “That was the plan, and you agreed to it.”. Daniel: “Sorry, I just couldn’t let you get killed. We should try to prevent them from escaping.”. They got up, and started following the guy. They remained hidden as well as they could. The escaped person had had quite a bit of headway before they started running after him, and they soon came to the conclusion that they had no idea where he went. So, they decided to head to the old church next to the market place. It had a back entrance, and had a vantage point over the entrances of the gliders. That would give them at least a chance to kill the soldier that had spotted Daniel. If they were then very lucky, the story hadn’t already spread. They got even more ambitious when they saw that the gliders were only guarded by three guards. They had turned off the gliders, so no simple and fast escape would be possible. Still though, it might help to kill them, and apply some brute force to the engines. They hid near the gliders, hoping they hadn’t been spotted. It seemed they had been, because the guards were laying down a defensive position. Therefore Sophia and Daniel decided to retreat, and go for their original plan to man the church. On the market-side of the church, it had two boarded-up windows. The boarding had been done long ago, and there was a hole in one of the two boardings, big enough to fit a gun through. It wouldn’t be enough for two, but one gun would still be nice. They had one rifle with them, and two revolvers, so they would be able to fire quite some bullets from relative safety. They waited there for some more time, until finally some soldiers returned. They looked injured, and were limbing towards the plane. Daniel recognised one of the two injured soldiers. He was the one who got away. He grabbed the weapon, not wanting to force Sophia to kill because of his decision. When he got near the glider, Daniel took aim, and fired a shot. He missed. As he missed, he suddenly felt an illness overcome him. It was as though he suddenly realised what he was doing. “Fuck, I’m killing people”, he said. Sophia tried grabbing the gun, saying : “Isn’t that the point. They would kill you otherwise.”. Daniel said: “That guy won’t, he’s injured. This is fucked up..”. Sophia said: “Yes, but if he survives, you will not be able to return to the Capital. Or at least, not for as long as the people in power there currently are in power.”. “So be it”, Daniel said. Tears were rolling over his face, as he felt he could never return home. He thought of his child, who he would probably never get to see. He thought of his girlfriend, who would never become his wife. Who would probably hate him for what he did. 

The gliders left, and the smoke started to settle on #Shard. There was a lot of destruction and death. After everyone had come to the conclusion that all the soldiers had left, they returned to their base of operation; an old farmhouse. They counted how many were there, four were missing. Two were confirmed dead, two weren’t found back. They decided to go looking for them, as well as for any wounded, surviving soldiers. They weren’t planning to just let them die. They may be running a rebellion, but they weren’t planning to just start killing people for no reason. Besides, they knew the military would come back at some point. They wouldn’t just accept defeat. 
They found the two rebels after some looking. They had bullet wounds in places you especially don’t want bullet wounds. One of the two looked like he might have a chance still, the other really didn’t look that way.

They burried the dead soldiers, and brought the dead rebels to the church. Meanwhile, they did what they could for the wounded. Afterwards, they held a meeting. They talked about their options. Daniel said: “We may have just won, but they will be back at some point. However, it might take some point, because they have another front; Beta-One. They probably only sent an advance force here to quickly deal with us. They must have assumed we were unarmed. That’s an assumption they won’t be making next time.”. Tom said: “This time we’ll have some of their rifles though, they left some of the weaponry with the dead. They really left in a hurry.”. Daniel said: “That’s because they had something they wanted to tell home.”. He stayed silent for a while, then sighed. “We were surrounded by five of them, and were getting overrun. In a spur of the moment, I picked up a gun, and killed three of them. Sophia killed the fourth one, but the fifth one got away. So, they may have wanted to send that message back home.”. Everyone stayed silent. Tom said: “You probably realised what this means.”. Daniel: “I can never go home.”. Tom said: “It’s a hollow thing, but I want to say it anyway: you’re welcome here.”. Daniel looked into the distance, not really paying attention to the situation at hand. After a while he got himself back a bit, and said: “Thank you. I didn’t mean to be mean, but it isn’t really the same as home here. But I guess this will be home now.”.

They held a service for those who had fallen. #x #y, #z. All of them had given everything for a case that had only just started to become serious. They sat down around a pyre, where they burned the dead. It was a beautiful ceremony, with friends of the fallen ones holding speeches. #DRAMA

The next day they spent on cleaning up the place, and readying it for battle. They were planning to fortify the market place, and add in metal scrap material on every big flat area. This would make it hard for gliders to land there. They then told the neighbouring shards to also prepare for an attack. They didn’t know for sure if they would be targeted again. The military might go for one of the neighbouring shards next, to lower their options to get resources and political allies. After this, they were in doubt. Partly they wanted to try to get to the operational cable car line, but this would mean a long travel, and risking being attacked or trapped in a cable car on every part of the way. If, at any point of the journey, they got stopped in the middle, they would run out of oxygen and die. And only one side of the cable car line would have to be locked, then the entire thing would just stall. So, they weren’t able to safely travel there. They decided in the end to move one shard further, leaving their home-shard looking like they prepared defenses there. They had sent the people who didn’t want to fight there previously, and had good relations with this shard. So, they felt like they could trust them not to fuck up the transport. They were able to all fit into one cable car, and did just that. A simple twenty-minute journey later they were in #ShardNAME4, which was part of a cluster of nearby shards. Seven shards were connected here, all by bridges. It looked pristine, with lots of water features, foresty parts, and beautifully rebuilt houses. It wasn’t on the same level as the Capital was, but still, it was pretty. The wood from the forest-shards must have helped with construction. Daniel learned that this shard was quite remote, but was able to be quite powerful and rich, because it had the only glass pane factory of the entire System. Besides that, they had their own food supplies, so they would be able to survive on their own. And, to top things off, they even had some weapons of their own. There had been a small gun club in this area, so they had quite a few guns. Not enough to stop a military if they really wanted to go there, but enough to at least cause some damage to such a force. The people there had been annoyed with the Capital’s stance for longer, believing there should be less difference based on where people lived. They felt like they were never taken seriously, even though they had also managed to rebuild their shards quite decently. Actually, their place probably was  the second most advanced place in the System, only behind the Capital. The thing that made this place even more amazing was something Daniel only figured out after spending a week there. There had been an anti-aircraft gun that was stored there. It wasn’t in perfect working condition, but they would try their best to fix it. It looked like it was of quite an old design, probably not able to fire more than a kilometer perhaps. This would still be enough to, after moving it, guard off all the major landing spots. And so it happened, they had an anti-glider gun standing ready, around twenty people, decently armed, enough food to last them a lifetime, and decent living environment. If it wasn’t for the war going on, Daniel could actually just settle down here. Oh, and if his girlfriend were to forgive him, and move here.

This place had everything, nice lush forests, beautiful lakes, and even a swimming pool. There was a garden filled with statues, with nice grassy fields in the garden. There was an old sign saying it was in French style, which Daniel thought probably referred to something from before the Event. Being there felt like a vacation that would never end.
And then it ended. Although they had anti-aircraft weaponry, they weren’t prepared for the new weapons the military were throwing at them. Instead of landing, they dropped weapons from big altitudes. Before they could lock onto the glider that flew by tho shoot it from the air, the glider had already dropped multiple bombs. Fires were engulfing the main complex of buildings. The anti-aircraft weapon fired a shot, but didn’t manage to hit the glider. It was very close. Very close is not something that gets you much in these kinds of situations though. The next glider run, they were better prepared. The spotters, standing on high points, managed to spot the glider well in advance, and the turret was able to lock onto it. It fired a shot, and this time it landed a hit. One of the engines seemed to be damaged, and it spun out of control. The pilot was able to get the plane under control again, but didn’t get it to really make speed again. It was going to crash regardless. With some luck and skill, the glider got to the ground in a somewhat controlled manner, and stayed intact upon hitting the ground. The crew of the glider, only seven people, was captured after they opened the doors of their craft. After this, the rebels concentrated on solving the fire. The building was burning quite heavily, and would probably be lost in it’s entirety. However, luckily, nobody was in the parts of the building that were initially hit, so everyone was able to evacuate in time. Daniel suggested to focus the effort on retreiving the things from the building that were of use, instead of focusing, in vain, on keeping the building standing. This was met by others with agreement, although they were sad to see paradise disturbed. It was a sign though that things would not be perfect forever. A bigger battle would be imminent, and they wouldn’t be able to do much about those gliders. Shooting one down was a great result, but it had been a lucky shot. Who knows how many bombs can be dropped before they could shoot down another of those fighters. Who knows how much would be left of this shard by the end of it. Who knows how much would be left of them by the end of it. 

The next night, Daniel had a weird dream. It was one of those dreams that made very little sense, but somehow did feel like it was meaningful. He was standing on a shard, but there was nothing there. No people, no buildings, no trees, just rock. He felt like there had been something there once, but not anymore. There was just nothing. He had walked around, but the shard seemed to be spherical; the landscape didn’t change. The sky had very few identifying features, mostly it was just empty. After this the landscape changed. He was walking through a city. It seemed to be from before the Event, because there were no other Shards in the air. Other signs of this were the working electric signs. There were no people though, the place was deserted. He walked around through the city, and found a statue. It was a statue of himself. The text said: “He who started the war that ended it all.”. Then, paper fell from the sky. Every piece of paper said the same thing:  “You doomed us all”. He heard a whisper: “Was it worth it”, and woke up. 

A bit dazed by this dream, he went back to working. They wanted to improve fire safety of existing buildings a bit, as well as getting enough defencive positions for people to be able to safely retreat during bombardments. This would at least mean they could survive. The next step beyond that would be a plan to strike back. The crashed glider was quite shaken up, but at some point it might be fixable. If they got some more parts, they might be able to build a single working Glider. The Glider doesn’t need much in the way of aerodynamics, because the gravity is fairly light as soon as it leaves the surface of a shard. So, basically, fixing it mostly concerns fixing the engines, and the life support systems. It turned out Sophia had a bit of a background in engineering. She suggested that, if the life support couldn’t be fixed, they could also turn the glider into a missile. It would fly straight into the Capital, doing some damage. This plan wasn’t met with much joy. It would mean giving up a massive amount of parts, just for doing some damage. Trying to get the life support to work, or even just getting the Glider airtight again, would make it infinitely more useful. Just being able to reach another Shard in the Outer Belt would be of huge benefit. For this, they mostly would need one functioning right Glider door. That door had a bullet hole, so the Glider would not be able to fly through the atmosphere for long. This would have been ok, had the craft still had life support. However, the life support had failed, together with quite a bit of the on-board electronics. So, either a new life support unit had to be found or created, or the door had to be plugged. After that, they would have a Glider to move elsewhere, changing the entire game. 
Four weeks later, they had fixed the parts of the Glider they could without having extra parts. It became obvious at this point that they wouldn’t be able to fix more of it without more parts. Strangely enough, no new attack had been attempted yet. The guess among the rebels was that the Capital was working on something bigger. To protect their work, the half-fixed glider was put inside a shed that didn’t have much purpose otherwise. A simple decoy was made of the Glider. From a distance, one might confuse it for the real thing. From nearby it would have no chance at fooling anyone. It simply wasn’t made out of the correct types of metal. During the same time, they sent out warnings into the cable car system. This was a pre-existing way to send messages to other people with similar political background. It would also reach government officials, because the system had been compromised quite some time ago. However, this would at least mean that everyone would be ready for battle. It didn’t say anything specific though, to prevent accidentally spreading information for their enemy. Basically, the message was: get ready for war, but don’t start it unless there’s good reason to do so. The rebels at #Shard4 had no way to know if that message had any effect, but they wanted to send it out. 

One morning, six dots appeared on the horizon. The people on #Shard4 knew the drill, so the people manning the Turret, and the spotters went to their spots, while the rest got into hiding in a small underground shelter. They were ready a few minutes before the actual attack started, a strange relaxedness hanged in the air. There was going to be destruction in a few minutes, but for now it was silent. Three of the gliders didn’t change their course as they flew towards the Shard. Instead, as they collided, they exploded. Two of the spotter posts were destroyed. Daniel saw this happen, but focused at the task at hand. There were still two gliders flying. They seemed to be actually manned. Or, the other three could have been manned, but they weren’t anymore. The remaining spotters tracked the gliders. One of the two was coming in. They shouted the direction from which it was coming to the people at the Turret. They set their controls to aiming, and shot. The Glider evaded the shot gracefully, and dropped a load of bombs. It hit one additional spotter team; only one of them was still standing. Also, the statue garden was destroyed, as was the bridge towards it. It was now a separated shard again. Eight deaths, and no glider had been shot down yet. This fight wasn’t going too great. The next run, both Gliders flew in at the same time. They lined up to aim for the turret. Even if they would be shot down, they would still destroy the turret. The turret shot anyway, after which the people standing next to it got away. One of the Gliders crashed into the Turret at full force, and exploded. By some miracle, none of the people manning the turret was seriously injured. The last glider flew away without dropping any bombs, probably to tell the message. The battle had been a pure loss. Four gliders had crashed down, but they probably wouldn’t have any salvageable parts. They had lost eight souls during the fight; Sophia, Daniel and Edward were the only three of the original team that were still standing. Their trusted friend and leader, Tom, had died when one of the kamikaze-gliders hit him. So, there wasn’t any reason for rejoice. #Burial. 

Over the next days, they tried skimming through the wreckages. They didn’t find much useful material. There was some scrap metal, and some spare parts for guns, but nothing special yet. Then, by some luck, someone who was just walking around found a strange apparatus. Upon inspection, it seemed to be an oxygen scrubber, one part of a life-support module. It wasn’t the full thing, so it couldn’t just be placed into the existing Glider. However, with some clever bodging, it might still work. After some preliminary testing, they figured out that it would indeed still give off oxygen, though less than the original specification said it would. It would be enough for a team of three to fly around in for an hour or so, after which it would have to be replenished. Not as good as the original functionality, but better than nothing. 

Over the next days, the Glider came closer and closer to being ready for flight. The engines were tested, and operational. The wings had almost their original shape again. It looked like a beaten-up Glider. However, it might just work. After doing all tests that could be done stationary, it was time for a test-flight. Since the whole mission by now came down to fixing this glider, they decided to just all three join the test flight. They didn’t feel like there would be a point of two of them continued. Besides, if it worked, they all would want to be a part of the first flight. So, they did the engine-start procedure, went through the checklists that were still lying there, and readied themselves for a rough ordeal. Edward and Sophia said prayers, Daniel respectfully stayed silent. They then removed the wheel lock, and the Glider started to move. Sophia, handling the controls, pulled steadily on the throttle. The Glider started to accelerate, while wobbling quite heavily. They weren’t too worried, because this seemed to just be from the fact that they were taking off from grass. After having reached a decent speed, Sophia pulled on the rudder, and they took off into the air. At this point, they put on their oxygen-masks, and flipped the switch to turn them on. They would have done this earlier, but had forgotten about it. They made a loop around the shard, checking all the systems of the Glider for faults. Basically, the on-board electric systems thought the Glider had crashed, and was now broken into pieces. Other than that, the Glider was doing perfectly fine as a Glider. Well, besides the damaged life support, and the lack of an atmosphere inside. But, if you get a free Glider, you can’t really be picky. They landed again, and checked the Glider for damage. It didn’t seem to have sustained any additional damage during the flight. So, they fixed up some exterior faults of the Glider, and called it a day. That evening, they talked about the future of their rebellion. They decided to go shard to shard, talking to people to gain traction. After having prepped enough people for a rebellion, they would disconnect the capital from the rest of the shards by strategically taking over Shards. Direct conflict would be shunned, so as soon as the Capital found out where the actual bottlenecks were, they would just stop the blockades, and move elsewhere. Direct confrontations would be avoided whenever possible, instead just focusing on disrupting the resource availability in the Capital. Since they had no way to reach the Capital without being immensively outnumbered, they found this was the best way to hurt the Capital. </Text>

            <Text>Daniel is split between wanting to figure out what’s going on in the world, and wanting to live a normal life. He wants to start a family with his girlfriend, he wants to just focus on his work. After he pulls at a thread, he can’t stop pulling, thinking the rope will stop at some point. Instead, it seems to unroll all the way. 
While he does this, his relationships with everyone and everything deteriorates, especially the one with his wife.
In the end, he decides to tell her, and she tells the government that he has gone insane. They had a two-year-old child by this point, and she was terrified of her child being hurt because of his stupidity. And since he betrayed her anyway, she felt this was justified.

Second part of story (if first one doesn’t get there): either his child, or someone else, and told as the story of someone who sees the world fall apart. Mimics the first arc to a certain extent, but on a bigger scale.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 3</Title>
            <Text>Two days later, Daniel had another strange dream. He, again, was alone on a shard. This time though, it had ruins on there. With some effort, he could recognise it as Monument Island. It had all the distinguishing features, but was overgrown with weed. It looked like nobody had been there for months, if not years. There were few signs of damage, only time seemed to have played it’s part. It seemed as though people had just disappeared, leaving nature to take its course. Suddenly, he heard a voice. It said: “This is what happens if the fight is going to go through.”. Daniel asked: “Who are you? Why are you in my dream?”. The mysterious voice answered: “Who I am is not that important right now. What’s important is that we try to save whatever is left to be saved.”. Daniel replied: “But if I don’t know who you are, why should I trust you? How do I know that you know better what’s going to happen?”. The voice answered the second question instead of the first: “Think of it like this: what good is it going to do if everyone is fighting each other? Whatever things were rebuilt so far will be destroyed again. The social hierarchy will be overthrown, but what will take it’s place? People outside the Capital are struggling, yes, but at least there’s infrastructure now so food can be transported. Besides large-scale harvest failures, food gets shared, so if there’s a lack of food in one place, people will share. Also, there’s trade going on again, so not everyone has to provide for themselves. You want to destroy all of that for a political cause?”. Daniel answered: “I don’t. I just want equality, or at least openness. It’s the Capital that doesn’t want to give us either.”. “Strong words, coming from someone who only just left the Capital. Do you really think your new friends would be more kind towards the people that would be under their power, if they had it? Or would it just reverse the roles? How do you think it would work if there’s scarcity then? It’s easy to be all for equality when you aren’t the one having to make the hard decisions.”. Daniel: “Sure, but that doesn’t mean I should just accept that the structure here is just broken forever, with no chance to change it.”. “True, but war wouldn’t have been the only alternative.”. Daniel: “Then you, mysterious voice, should tell me: what should I have done instead?”. There was no answer. “Just as I thought.”. The mysterious voice answered: “Perhaps we should talk again later. We shall meet again.”. Daniel woke up.

The plan was simple: go from Shard to Shard, telling the people there about their mission. They would have to refuel after about seven stops. So, either they would have to steal fuel somewhere, or the seventh stop would have to be near where they wanted to be in the end. That would lose them the glider, but it would mean not having to break into something well-protected. 
Everywhere they went, they were met with applause. Their story had preceded them, and they were welcomed as heroes. They told the story of their heroic fights against the Gliders, and told people about why they should also pick up their weapons and fight. They explained that if everyone cooperated, they would fight the Capital twenty to one. So, even with no way to reach the Capital, they would be able to hurt them to the point of them having to give in and grant them some rights as well. It was odd to see that, suddenly, there was no fighting going on. It almost seemed as though the Capital had given up. In fact though, they were just re-organising, and figuring out their next step. 
After three visits, they decided to do three more visits, on Shards around the secondary cable car station. If those three could be convinced to go on strike, there would be no way to get cargo in and out of the Capital. It would be locked off from the Outer Shards. And even if they managed to break one of the three strikes, they would still have a crippled input. The plan was to tell people to stop transporting, and tell people to prepare the cable car stations for sabotage. The idea was that if they were attacked, they would destroy the link with the Capital. This would mean that the Capital would no longer be connected to the rest of the Shards, and if they tried to do something about this, they would lose their connections for even much longer. The plan seemed perfect at a first glance. It was surprisingly easy for them to convince the people on these shards to go on strike. They had been wanting to do it for a while, but, without coordination they had no reason to do so. It simply wouldn’t have much effect, unless all three would go on strike at the same time. 
A few days later, it would be the day of the reunion. This was a celebratory day, signifying the moment the Capital was reconnected with this group of Outer Shards. Therefore, it was seen as a significant moment to choose to go on strike. Why not take a symbolic date to start your rebellion? On that day, a note was sent with the final shipment of goods towards the Capital. All three wrote on their note that they were going on strike, demanding better conditions for the Outer Shards. It stated this was a coordinated strike, and that almost all of the Outer Shards was aware of this, and agreed with it. There was no immediate response. The note stated that they would slowly run the cable car service once more the day later, holding it mid-transport for three days by applying the brakes. The reasoning was that this would mean there was no oxygen left in the vehicle by that point, so no soldiers could transport with it. They also stated that if they recognised that it was a passenger vehicle, they would hold it there indefinately. A harsh threat, but at least it meant the Capital could send one last message towards the Outer Shards before they would go radio-silent. The Capital replied: “We want to talk. Let’s meet on Octogon. This was of course a symbolic location, the first location of rebellion. It was also fairly far away, meaning the glider would run out of fuel going there. Therefore, they couldn’t really go there. So, they replied: we lack the fuel to make such a trip. They didn’t really want to send this message, because they gave away that their Glider was practically out of commission, but it was the only thing they could really do to try and make something of the situation.”. The message from the rebels included that the same reply-strategy would be used again. With this strategy, for one message to return, multiple days passed. A couple of days later, the Capital replied: “Ok, then what about we send you the fuel, and you refuel your Glider with it. Then we can meet at Octogon.”. The rebels thought about it, and decided to agree. Although they didn’t fully trust the Capital, they found that they had to at least somewhat listen to them and trust them, or there was no point to this situation. After comparing the fuel in substance to the fuel already in the Glider, they came to the conclusion that (a) it looked like Glider fuel, and (b) they had no way to chemically test if it indeed was Glider fuel. It didn’t seem to contain sand at least, so if it was sabotaged, it was done in a more sophisticated way. The rebels decided to first take a test flight with the new fuel, before they would allow mission-critical staff on-board. Losing Daniel, Sophia and Edward in a crash would probably mean the end of the rebellion, so was it reasoned. They had attracted new people, but they were the face of the rebellion, the others only followed. The test flight didn’t turn out to be a disaster. So, they decided to take the risk and fly to Octogon. They didn’t aim for Octogon to begin with, first they flew in the direction of Shard4. They would do a short landing there, to stretch their legs, and observe Octogon from a distance. If it turned out to be a trap, they would have a chance of knowing. At least, that was the reasoning. Upon landing on Shard4, they saw nothing strange at Octogon. So, they flew to Octogon. When they flew over it, they saw no weapons systems there. There was three people standing there. They might have been armed, but it didn’t look that way. They landed a safe distance away from them, and approached by foot. Daniel recognised one of them. It was Charles. He stood still for a short moment, reminiscing the past. How close he had come to living a normal life. It wasn’t meant to be for him, it seemed. He continued approaching them, before Sophia and Edward got confused by his behaviour. They shook hands, and introduced themselves. On the other side of the conversation they had Charles, #MinistryOfOuterShardsName and #vicePresidentName, representing the Ministry of Resources, the Ministry of Outer Shards, the latter being the Vice-President. It seemed the Capital had really sent their improtant people this time. And without an army to back them up it seemed. This got them suspicious, what else did they have as security then? The Vice-President took the word: “Hello, and thank you for meeting us. I know we would rather not have to have this conversation, and I hope this is likewise.”. Daniel nodded. She continued: “You probably already figured out that we must have some sort of security; something we held back and didn’t tell you? Otherwise we wouldn’t have come here without military force to back us up?”. She stayed silent , possibly to add dramatic effect. “Well, we have planted explosives throughout the three shards which you so cleverly took over. You see, our people could also do the math, and had predicted this would happen. All it took was taking some children prisoner, and the people there were all for planting explosives there to stop you. People are so easy to manipulate.”. Daniel, Sophia and Edward stayed silent. Finally, Edward, the mostly silent one, took the word: “Then we’re in a deadlock, aren’t we? Since we’re armed, we could take you three prisoner, and you have your bombs as a threat.”. She replied: “Thing is though, we’re willing to go through with our plan. If we don’t send the signals, the bombs will explode. The three of us would be an acceptable loss. Besides that, I don’t think you would go about killing us. History showed you had problems with that.”. She looked at Daniel. Charles said: “We were very disappointed to figure out you switched sides. What did they offer you in return?”. Daniel was silent for a while, and, in the end, replied: “The truth..”. “The truth? Does it even exist? You mean the fact that the Capital is willing to do what it takes? We kept people alive? Can you see the same about your little rebellion? Look at the destruction you have caused.”. Daniel: “That was only because you decided to attack us, instead of talking to us.”. “There was nothing to talk about. The things you proposed weren’t executable. It would have lead to much more suffering than would have been worth it. Our attacks were calculated to be the lesser evil.”, Charles replied. Daniel asked: “How do you know such things? You haven’t even bothered to listen to us! All we wanted is to be kept in the loop about what was going on. We didn’t even want fully equal rights, we just wanted people out here not to starve.”. Charles: “All we in the Capital told you guys is what we would need to survive, and to rebuild society. We asked for a bit more than was strictly necessary, true, but that’s because you can’t expect engineers to work on a minimal diet. They work much better if they are well-fed. If you want to know why people are starving, you should ask the people on shards such as Beta-One. They are the ones deciding who needs to contribute what. They are the ones controlling the logistics. We neither have the manpower nor the will to control it all.”. Daniel looked at her with disbelief. “You’re telling me you’re not responsible for what’s going on in the Outer Shards?”. “Well, to some extent, I guess we are. We defined the rules which are used to govern them. However, the people here in the Outer Shards are the ones that actually are awful to eachother. We are merely guilty by not providing better rules.”. Daniel thought for a bit. Sophia answered in his stead: “So, you’re asking us to just go back and start living our lives as though this didn’t happen?”. #VP answered: “That would probably be the best for all of us, but I don’t see that happening. Besides that, the Capital demands some form of justice for what happened here. We could not just let this slip and expect everything to turn to normal again. We need to make an example out of this. The system has to stand, for humanity to survive.”. Daniel thought that it was convenient for someone who had it all to defend the system, while the people who got the bad end of the deal thought it wasn’t a good deal. He asked: “How are you supposed to have us convince our people that the system as it is is a fair system? Even if we did what you asked, it still wouldn’t happen. They have been told that they would get more, now they have to get more.”. “They will get more. Just not today. They just have to wait, things will improve in the future.”, she replied. Sophia said: “Do you have anything to back these promises up?”. #VP replied: “Well, to start with, everyones quality of life has improved over the last few years.”. Edward accidentally interrupted her, mumbling : “Except for those who died of starvation.”. #VP looked at him with mild annoyance, and continued: “Almost all lives have improved over since the event. Not everything has gone perfectly all the time, but the chances of starvation are lower. Education is increased. There are more options for self-growth. At the end of the day, there is a lot less poverty, and even the people living in poverty have it less bad than the first period after the Event. I’ll admit there’s wealth inequality. But, part of that is necessary to sustain certain types of jobs. Part of it is even that by giving people who achieved more, we give people a reward for being more useful.”. Daniel replied: “You mean: you give people a reward for living in the Capital.”. She replied: “I’ll admit that the people in the Capital have a higher quality of living. This is also caused by the fact that in the Capital, only people live with better-paying jobs, one way or another.”. Daniel said: “That’s plainly not true though, because a cleaner in the Capital has a better life than almost everyone in the Outer Shards. So, it’s clearly about where you live rather than what your purpose is. With very few exceptions, this is the rule by which the world here works”. She replied: “Anyway, we’re not getting anywhere. Our deal we offer is the following. If you release the cable car stations from your control without causing further harm, we won’t do anything to harm you all either. Have your own people leave these shards without any further provocations, and tell your allies to stand down. If you do that, we won’t be executing on our threat to violence. We’re looking forward to seeing your reaction, we hope it’s the wisest one.”. They shook hands, and both groups retreated to their own glider. On the way back, they considered their options. They could check if the Capital was bluffing, and stay there. If it was bluff, then they would be able to sit it out. They could also choose to retreat and reorganise. As a third option, they could evacuate, but tell the locals to keep the position. The shards would be blown up, which would make the people there martyrs for the cause. This could be combined with a more permanent sabotage of the stations. They could also decide to try and defuse the bombs. This would be quite tricky, because they could be hidden anywhere. Finally, they could choose to just attack. This would, without a doubt, lead to many victims, and make them look even more like villains. However, it would be a step forward to a certain degree.
None of the three knew how to decide between these options. If the bomb story was fake, staying there would, by far, be the best option. If it wasn’t fake, the reaction depended on how much value was given to the lives of the people living on these Shards. If the value was seen as fairly low, then the option of simply letting it get blown up, and using that as a marketing thing would make sense. If these lives were seen as more vital, then they would have to leave without making a mess. 
Daniel said: “Whatever we do, everyone who’s involved has to make their own decision consciously I would say. If we ask people to stay behind, we have to tell them about the possibility of bombs having been planted. If we don’t do that, we’d be monsters. Sophia replied: “But then they wouldn’t want to see that plan to. That plan may be the best option we have. Just refusing to do it out of a sense of morality feels wrong to me. Sometimes you have to be bad, in order to defeat a greater evil.”. Daniel replied: “You may believe that, but I don’t. I believe everyone’s decisions are for themselves. And the people on these Shards can’t make their own decisions for themselves if they don’t know what’s going on around them. So we would then have to tell them about the risk they’d be taking, and about why wouldn’t take the risk with them.”. Edward nodded. Edward wasn’t one of many words, he preferred to think, and say something when it really mattered. The discussion right now was much too philosophical for his liking, so he wisely stayed out of it. For him, practical points are much more important than the theoretical reasons behind things. He therefore replied: “Is letting thirty allies die in horrible explosions worth it, compared to being able to hold these positions for longer, perhaps a lot longer, because they could swoop back in and reclaim them. And even better, they would know if the Capital was capable of this kind of an organised attack. They had a feeling it was capable of much, but getting an idea about the limits of the Capital would be worth quite a lot. Whether or not that’s worth the lives we’re putting at stake I don’t know. You two may have more experience with these kinds of decisions.”. Daniel said: “Well, I have a fundamental problem with not telling people about the risks we want them to take. Sophia doesn’t, and just wants the best possible outcome. We have nobody else to ask for an opinion on this. So I guess it comes down to the three of us. I would prefer if we were unanymous about this, but I don’t know if that will be possible. The opinions may not be reconsilable.”. Edward said: “What if we flee away, and secretly spread the story of this shard. Then we tell select people there that after a period of resuming normal operation, another strike should be started. By that time, more people around will have heard of the situation there, and how the Capital is threatening to kill innocent people there. Because, besides the few people that handle the strike, most people there actually have no involvement in it. It would show the brutality of the Capital. I don’t feel like what happens after is really our responsibility, because we can’t be held accountable for the deeds of someone else. Not giving in to a threat is not the same as being responsible for the result. The only ones responsible for what happens are the people at the Capital.”. Daniel asked: “So, you would tell everyone in the world, except for most people on the Shards where the lives are at risk?”. Edward said: “Exactly. Because telling the people there will make them not execute the strike. And that strike is vital, without it, our position is hopeless. They would always be able to force someone to trade with them. We need to take away that trading power from them.”. So, in the end, they decided to run away with the people who were directly under their control, and tell the others to lay low, preparing for a new strike in a couple of weeks. They indeed managed to evacuate without a problem, and slowly started to spread rumors about the Capital having placed bombs under the Shards. This would be known by some spies from the Capital. However, these would rely on the cable car network to get the message across, and it probably wouldn’t. So, even though some people on their side knew about it, it would take very long for them to get a message across. Especially since at every point, messages were held for as long as practically possible. Simply put, most people operating the cable cars hated the messages from the secret service. They never adhered to the standardized format, they never came in in time for the next batch, they always acted as though they would be of highest priority, and they just generally weren’t nice to the people runnng the system. As a rule, if you are an asshole towards others, they won’t be doing more for you than they strictly have to. So, strictly speaking, they would have to send messages across. However, if it went ‘a bit slower’, that would not really get them into trouble, so they just did. 

So, everyone except for the people in the Capital knew that a second strike was coming. It was announced almost everywhere. They would this time not do full on strikes, but just only transport very inefficiently. They would, strictly speaking, still do their job, but the Capital wouldn’t nearly get enough, and would often not get the things they asked for. The reasoning was that this kind of a strike could be held for much longer, and was also much easier to grow. Just one person in one office could, if working ineffectively, have quite an impact on the overall performance of the group. It was interesting to see how much of a result this had. There was barely any cargo moving through to the Capital, let alone anything they actually wanted. 

They must have figured it out. Black smoke appeared in the distance a few days later, surrounding the three shards that had gone on strike. So, the Capital had made good on their promise. Daniel, Sophia and Edward decided to fly to as many of them as possible, to see if the sabotage of the stations had indeed worked. If this was the case, then, at least, it would mean that both sides had lost. It seemed that mutually assured destruction was a term that was misunderstood by both parties in this conflict. The Capital had just killed much of the active assistants of the rebellion, but, at the same time, they had destroyed the last part of infrastructure connecting them to the rest of the world. Well, besides the cable car line that was still on strike, and the line that was under construction. Still though, things weren’t looking good for them either. Daniel, Sophia and Edward were able to complete the sabotage of the three stations from these shards leading up to the connector-shard. It didn’t take much time at all, because the work had already been prepared. Still though, it would take weeks to repair, at the least. So, now the conflict settled down again. Both sides had suffered huge losses, one in material strategic position, the other in people. Neither party was showing any signs of heading towards reconsiliation.

Daniel had another strange dream. This time he was not alone. There was someone else standing there. Someone he hadn’t met before. Someone new. He felt like this person was not part of his imagination somehow. As though that person was real in the same sense that he himself was. He walked towards this person with a sense of curiosity and fear, like someone who sees a stranger suddenly sitting in their living room. On one hand, it’s fairly scary, but on the other end, who is it? What are they doing there? And since the person made no attempt to hide, they must have wanted to meet, Daniel reasoned. “I tried contacting you before, but it didn’t work”, this person said. I tried showing you what would happen… But you didn’t listen. You didn’t seem to grasp what I was trying to say. Do you see it already? It’s too late, but do you at least see it now?”. Daniel asked: “Too late for what? Bridges can be rebuilt.”. “Physical ones can, but the canyon you helped form between people outside and inside the Capital can’t be filled up in time. The suffering that follows will be on your hands.”. Daniel asked, again: “Who are you? Why are you telling me this?”. “I was tasked with taking care of this world, to prepare it for a future that would have to come. A future that was started when the Experiment took place. I’ve been trying to keep everything together after the Event. However, I hadn’t seen this conflict coming. It hadn’t occurred to me that humans could be this self-destructive.”. Daniel: “You mean, this principal about wanting to be treated humanly?”. “Humanly, interesting choice of words. What does it even mean? Does not getting access to everything mean you aren’t free? And besides, this was going to be a transition period. In thirty years, all of this would have been fixed. Now, I would be surprised if more than a couple of people make it that far.“. Daniel: “Why do you think it will go that badly? There’s still plenty of farms in the Outer Shards, and most of the infrastructure here is still intact.”. “Who’s gonna keep running those systems once the Capital falls apart? Don’t underestimate how important they were to you all. They provided the blueprints for society. You didn’t get a say in it, but you were a part of the design. A design you’ve vandalised. Now, it’s crippled, and it will fall. Congratulations. Ah well, at least you’ll be free when you die.”. Daniel woke up.

Just because they were cut off from the rest of the world, didn’t mean the Capital wasn’t trying to solve their problems. They attempted to take back their one last connected cable car station. Much to their surprise, they were able to claim it without trouble. The rebels had moved on elsewhere. Instead, there was nothing there. It still worked, but all the goods had moved elsewhere. To their pleasant surprise though, the prisoners that had been kept there were still there, with a big enough pile of food that they could have stayed there for much longer. The rebels that had taken this base had decided to join Daniel, Sophia and Edward. Although they were the initiators, they didn’t feel like they were the ones who were the lead in the fight anymore. That role was now with Daniel, Sophia, and Edward. They would have to see that the rebellion would lead somewhere.

Over the next few weeks, some skirmishes were fought, but, mostly, the status quo was maintained. This meant that the Capital didn’t have access to resources, and the rebels didn’t have access to knowledge and technology. Slowly, over time, things outside the Capital started to break. Factories didn’t get their proper repairs, industry didn’t get managed properly, production didn’t have the demand to back it up. There were goods, but there wasn’t really anyone who wanted these things. So, after a while, people stopped making luxury goods alltogether, focusing instead on farming. It seemed food was going to stay scarce for a while still, so there was little to support people who weren’t farming. They had no way of knowing how the Capital was doing, but they supposed that the Capital must be out of resources by now. So, two months after the last time they had contact, another meeting was scheduled. 
The tone of this meeting was drastically different from the previous meeting, it was much more grim. #VP was there again. She kicked off by asking: “Are you happy now? Everything is slowly falling apart.”. Daniel replied: “No, we aren’t happy about this, but we still stand by our position. We don’t see why you wouldn’t just lower your arms and let us take over. It would be much better for everyone.”. She replied: “We can’t, that wouldn’t work. You wouldn’t be able to keep everything running.”. She waited for a bit, continuing: “Anyway, we wanted to say we no longer have an interest in this bullshit. We want you to know that we managed to build a weapon that can destroy a shard at once. It’s a missile, so you can’t stop it. By the time you see it’s coming you’re already too late. So, in everyone’s interest, please restart cooperation with us.”. Daniel replied: “It sounds like you’re bluffing. And even if you aren’t, why would you kill a lot of innocent people just to get your way?”. She replied: “Because this rebellion stands to kill humanity. The longer this continued, the lower the chance that we survive as a whole. It isn’t just about you or me, it’s also about that.”. Daniel replied: “Then why not be a bit more giving instead of only threatening? Why not suggest fair trade between the Outer Shard and the Capital? Or come with concrete plans towards democracy and openness of information? You only do threats, nothing more.”. She replied: “Because we didn’t think giving that kind of information would be helpful yet. And we still aren’t convinced that that will help. For instance, independence of the Outer Shards means a lot of time and energy will be spent on convincing people, that’s better spent on actually solving the problems at hand. The problem isn’t with the system as a whole, the problem is with trust.”. Daniel: “Trust you yourself destroyed at some point, when people started dieing here of starvation. You can claim to be helping people, but those people that starved weren’t helped. They would have been better off without you.”. She replied: “You’re repeating yourself. Anyway, we wanted to tell you that you have two options: either drop your weapons and surrender, or face full on war. We are done holding back. We’re unwilling to negociate further.”. Sophia and Edward had let Daniel do the talking so far, but were starting to get annoyed by where the conversation was going. Sophia interrupted, saying: “Why can’t you just grant us a bit more rights. Give us the right to self-govern, and give us some insight in what the government is doing. That way we could sell this as a win for us as well, meaning it would be much easier to end this.”. #VP replied: “But isn’t it already very easy to sell this as a win? You don’t get destroyed by weaponry much stronger than anything you can ever hope to use against us?”. Edward said: “Threats get people to stay in line, but if they actually believe in the cause they will be of much more use to you. That would mean there wouldn’t be another revolution in a couple of years.”. She replied: “There won’t be another revolution. In a decade or so, the economy will have recovered, and everyone will be better off than they ever were before. And by everyone I mean Everyone, not just the rich people in the Capital.”. Sophia said: “Sounds good. If you give us one small thing we can present as a victory, then this can all be over.”. #VP said: “No. We can’t have that. It has to be a pure win for the Capital. Also, we’ll want the people responsible to be punished. We can guarantee they will not be receiving the Death penalty, but other than that, we can’t give any guarantees. It’ll have to be a fair trial.”. Daniel said: “We can’t do that. We don’t believe we are much to blame here, at least no more than the leadership in the Capital. So, if you don’t intend to put those on trial as well, we won’t be doing that.”. #VP said: “We can’t do that. Putting our leadership to trial would seriously destabilize the political landscape, causing major problems. Besides that, without allowing an alternative truth to also exist in the Capital, there’s no point in even putting them to trial. There’s, in the official truth, nothing that the Council has done wrong. You may agree with that, but that’s more the problem than the solution.”. Daniel said: “In that case we can’t accept your terms. I’m sorry about that, but we’re not going to be the ones that take the fall.”. #VP: “In that case it will be war. War with who knows how many deaths, possibly killing us all. You had a chance to prevent it, remember that.”. She turned around and walked back to her glider. Sophia grabbed a handgun from her pocket. She aimed at the VP. Daniel, who was standing next to her, pushed her hand down, and said: “No, let’s not lower our standards just because we’re at war. Remember, we are the good guys.”. Sophia sighed, “She’s one of the people most responsible for what’s going to happen next. Much more so than any of the people that will be killed during the conflict. Why is she an exception? Just because she’s unarmed?”. Daniel replied: “Exactly. Also, because we may want to talk to them again at some point. Breaching this trust would mean we could never back down anymore. The trust would be gone, forever.”. Sophia put the gun away. There was a moment of silence. After a minute or so, Edward broke the silence, suggesting to head back to the glider. “There’s still a lot of work to do before the war truly starts”, he said. “We’d better be ready”.

They were not really ready. Against a full attack of an organised enemy, the rebels simply weren’t prepared. They had the motivation to fight, sure, but lacked the organisation, the weapons, the strategic insight, and most other things that made a military force in a full conflict. The Capital increased their commitment to the conflict by quite a margin. Instead of two gliders being used, they used fifteen ones now. This meant that, suddenly, they had an advantage in numbers. So, wherever the Capital’s army went, they were in a numerical advantage. This meant that they could just go to a shard, win a fight there, disrupt the situation, and then go back before they could be attacked in reverse. The rebels were simply too spread out to be easily able to defend.
Luckily for them, Daniel and Sophia started to take notice. They started a project to group forces. The idea was that part of the shards would be left empty to start with. The most strategically important one would be used for military use. The idea was that this would limit the conflicts to the parts with military value. They underestimated the game the Capital was playing however. They assumed that the Capital was out there to destroy the rebels. This was true, but the Capital was going for more. They didn’t just want to destroy the rebels. They wanted to destroy the meaning of this rebellion. They wanted to make people feel that the rebellion would not bring the things they thought it would bring. So, instead of attacking the military shards, they attacked the ones that were undefended. This meant that a lot of farmers were killed during this conflict. In this way, not just the Capital would suffer from hunger, but the Outer Shards would soon start to suffer from it as well. To make things worse, the Capital had started to launch rockets. These weren’t strong enough to destroy full shards, but they could, seemingly randomly, attack people in the Outer Shards. This meant that nobody really had a sense of security anymore, with bombs able to fall at any moment. </Text>

            <Title>Scene 4</Title>
            <Text>Not much was standing after the conflict was over. The sheer destructive force of the weapons used had destroyed most liveable land. The population of the region had dropped from 200 000 to an unknown number, which was only going to drop even further because of a lack of food, water, and all other necessary goods.
 
Within this chaos, Edward was the first of the three to die. A missile hit a complex where he was working. The others two had been nearby, but due to luck weren’t hit by the missiles. In the chaos of the attack however, Daniel was captured, and taken to the Capital. He was taken to a prison complex, awaiting interrogation. However, much to his surprise, he wasn’t interrogated. Instead, they just sent him home. As Daniel was walking through the streets he could notice that everyone was staring at him. With reason, of course, but still. A child on a corner picked up a small rock, and threw it at him. “Traitor” was screamed at him. He stopped in front of his home. He saw the flat was full of life. His to be wife was there, with a child in her hands. With her, however, was another man. They seemed to be enjoying each others company. Daniel sighed, and walked off. He couldn’t really return there. So, he went to the hiding spot near the Inn, to look for Violet and the Innkeeper. He found traces of the fact that they had lived there, but nothing more. They must have had to move out at some point. Maybe they moved to a better spot, but, more probably, they had been caught. Daniel felt himself slowly getting increasingly uneasy. Everything here that was connected to him had disconnected itself from him. There was nothing left that wanted him, or needed him. There was just things that had at one point been in his life. He went to the monument island to think. He found a nice spot near the big fountain, and sat down. He had expected to have to give everything. He had expected to have to fight. He had expected that nobody in his previous life would like him anymore. But.. This felt wrong to him. He was suddenly outside the conflict, unable to do anything about it. He was behind enemy lines, but had nothing really to do there. He was probably watched by some secret police right now, so he could not even do one last heroic deed. It would just be foiled. The only thing he could think of was doing the unthinkable.
He decided against that. Instead, he went back to the Inn. It was taped shut, stated for lack of rent payment. Seemed logical; the owner was no longer there. He entered, and looked for food. He didn’t expect anyone to mind him taking the food from there, so he just decided to take it. When he looked for a spot to lie down, he found that there was an upper floor. He went there, and found a bedroom. It had a desk, a closet, and some other furniture. The window was overlooking the street. Interesting, Daniel thought, I never noticed this window being there. It’s even quite big. He got curious, so he started to look around. He found a note. It explained how the Innkeeper and Violet, after not receiving food (from Daniel) anymore, were forced to go outside. They had waited for a week-and-a-half for him to come back, and when he didn’t, they had no choice but to go outside. They said they had stockpiled on all they thought they would need for staying under there a bit longer. Below that, the handwriting became more erratic. It stated that there was someone coming. Someone they didn’t know. It said the door was being breached. The note ended on the text: “We’re going to make a run for it.”. There was a staircase going up from this floor. Daniel guessed this is where they must have fled. He followed the staircase up, and ended up on the roof. It had a nice view, but it was not well-connected to the rest of the buildings. Anyone trying to get out of here would have to jump. One spot looked like it should have had a metal staircase going down, but that must have gone quite a while ago, because nothing of it remained. Daniel looked for other traces of where they could have gone. He knew he wouldn’t find them back like this. He knew their story has no chance to have ever ended well; he had been gone for months by now. However, it was the only thing keeping him going, because, other than that, there was nothing in the Capital that made him feel like he belonged there. Nothing that reminded him of who he was, or had become. There was just things that reminded him of who he could have been. He saw traces of an attempt at a jump. They must have jumped a two-and-a-half meter gap to another building. He looked down the gap. It was quite a bit down. Daniel didn’t know what else he expected to see there. There was no horribly mutilated body, if that’s what he had been looking for. Nothing there that would have told the story of something that happened there before. But, then again, it happened months ago. Daniel walked away from the edge and took a deep breadth. Had anyone told him that he would jump from building to building over a gap, when falling in would result in almost certain death, he wouldn’t have believed it. Ah well, he thought, there have been lots of things he hadn’t believed to be possible that were possible now. It was just the world he was living in. Daniel ran, and took the jump. As his feet left the ground, he could notice something was wrong. He lost his grip, and expected this to be the end. Instead, he was sort of just hanging there. He wasn’t exactly not falling, but he just wasn’t doing it as quickly yet as it would have been expected. Therefore, he had enough time to grab hold of the edge of the building. With some effort, he pulled himself back up. Surprised as he was, he was even more surprised to hear the mysterious voice talk to him. This was reality after all, not his dreams. “You probably figured out that something strange is going on. You may have just figured out that you are able to do something that you shouldn’t be. It’s hard to explain what really happened, but, basically, you can slow down time around you for a short while.”. Daniel didn’t really know what to say about this. He thought about an answer, or a question even. The voice was ahead of him: “ You’re probably wondering why you got this power, or from where. Well, you were one of the people that had a huge influence on the fate of this world. Due to reasons I’m not permitted to explain, you got this power.”.
 Daniel asked: “What is expected of me now? To be some sort of a superhero?”. The voice responded: “Isn’t that expected of everyone? Joking aside, nothing is expected from you. You have this power, and you can use it as you please. Nobody will even take it away if you use it in ways that are less than moral”. Daniel asked if it had limits. The voice responded: “It’s best not to overstress this skill, it has it’s limits. At a certain point time will have to move forward regardless of whether you want it to or not. Other than that, you should figure it out on your own.”. Daniel asked: “How do I cause it to happen? It just happened by accident just now.”. The response was: “You have to actually really want it. If you don’t really really want it, it won’t happen. So, if you’re about to fall to your death, it’s easier to use than to use it to steal some sweets.”. Daniel decided he would try it out. HE found a nice little rock, and threw it up. He walked away from it, and as it was about to hit the ground, he tried to walk towards it with time slowed down. Time didn’t slow down however, and the rock fell on the ground. The voice said: “It’s hard to want something if there are no real stakes. If you’re just trying it out, you’re fine with failing. When you were about to fall to your death, you really really wanted to hold on to prevent falling any further. Therefore, you got some time to fix it. It’s not about the  fact that you want time to slow down, it’s about the fact that you want more time to solve a certain problem. So, if you want to test this skill, you have to get into a bit of risk.” Daniel said: “Ok. Then I won’t test it any further while here. Instead, I’ll keep following the trail.” He jumped across to the other building. This time he succeeded without much effort. He was looking for signs where Violet and #innkeep might have gone, or even just signs that they had been here. He found that the metal door leading to a staircase going down had it’s lock bashed in from the roof-side. This meant that someone tried to break into the staircase going down, while coming from the roof. Daniel followed this staircase down. He ended up in a small ally. There was  mostly trash bags laying there, without anything to merit going there. He looked down and saw that the staircase could be pushed down to ground level. He did so, and climbed down. A scruffy looking cat ran away, underneath a fence that looked like it was blocking off nothing. However, since the other end came out straight onto the straight, Daniel was pressed to figure out what was behind the fence. He didn’t really fear for much here, because it’s the Capital after all. Crime rates are low here. Illegal dumping of waste, such as in this ally, was pretty much as criminal as people got in the Capital. Daniel observed the fence. It looked quite sturdy, although it had seen better days. However, the lock seemed to be missing, so the gate could be opened without much effort. With a high-pitched noise, the gate opened, and revealed a overgrown garden. It looked like it hadn’t seen any love for at least five years. Yet, somehow, Daniel wasn’t convinced that he was alone here. He slowly entered the garden, taking care not to needlessly destroy anything there as he went along. He didn’t want to disturb the place. It was a narrow garden, barely wider than the ally. The shape was not rectangular, it widened out. It seemed that it just was the entire area between the buildings. Since the buildings weren’t built in a grid, the garden was strangely formed as well. Some of the plants looked older, placed in patterns that looked like they had, at one point, been placed there on purpose. There were small stone walls, which probably at one point had ornate flowers growing in the earth behind the stone walls. However, now these areas were covered in weed. The path in the garden got nicer at some point. It turned from sand to stone, and no plants had reclaimed this part of the path yet. There was moss growing on the stones, but that was the extent to which this part was overgrown. In this area, it looked like some of the plants were actually grown there by people. They were placed in nice lines of plants, and a suspicious number of them looked edible to Daniel. The path ended at a back door of a building. Daniel wasn’t sure what type of a building it was; it had a sunshade, and a terrace next to the entrance, but, other than that, it looked like a regular home.  There were spiderwebs behind the window of the door. It at least didn’t seem as though anyone really gave the building a lot of love. It was dirty, gritty, and looked like it might collapse without further warning. Daniel knocked on the door. He thought he heard some movement, but nobody seemed to be heading to the door to let him in. He tried the doorknob; the door was unlocked. He knocked another time, and went in. The air smelled as though the place hadn’t had fresh air move through it for some time. Other than that, it’s interior looked like a regular house, with a living room, kitchen, and a staircase going upstairs. Everything looked a bit crooked, and the place looked like it was already old by the time of the Event. So, it was ancient by now. Instead of stone, a lot of wood was used in this building. The roof was quite a bit higher than Daniel’s home, and was ornately decorated. Daniel decided to look upstairs first, to see if anyone else was there. He didn’t want to look through the place without knowing if the owner was home, or has been home recently. If the place still seemed owned, he wouldn’t want to take from it, otherwise he would take supplies here, maybe even staying here for a bit. Instead of finding a person, he found a cat that was eating from a bag of cat food. It was the same cat that had ran away when he entered the ally. He tried to approach the cat, and the cat walked towards him. It obviously wanted to be petted. Daniel petted the cat, scratching his ears, and belly. The cat seemed to really enjoy the attention it was receiving. After the cat had decided it was enough, the cat walked off and laid down in a corner of the room. Daniel decided to look around. It didn’t seem that there was anyone living here right now. The place was extremely dusty and dirty, but looked like it had been nice until the people living there had disappeared. There were no signs of struggle, no signs of damage, violence, or anything similar. At some point, it seemed, the owner or owners had just left. Daniel observed the bedroom. It had a two-person bed in it, but it looked like only one person was sleeping there; it had one pillow on the head end of the bed, in the middle. The blanket also would have been somewhat on the small end for two persons. Daniel decided to open a window for fresh air, and then look around more. He opened some closets, looking for things that might be interesting for him to look at. He really wondered who had been living here, and why they had just disappeared. The upper floor didn’t have that much interesting laying around, so Daniel went back downstairs. The cat followed him down. Daniel noticed there was a pile of mail laying on the doormat. Mostly it was newspapers. He decided to look on the bottom of the pile, to see on which date the place had gone empty. It was the exact date on which Violet had gone into hiding. Daniel wasn’t too surprised by this; there aren’t that many houses that are empty in the Capital, and most would be repurposed after they were found to be vacated. This house however, was such a strange house that it might be hard to find a new owner for it. It wasn’t small, but it was really strange in layout. The house was not rectangular in base. It was more of a triangle with a strange rounded corner. The building, both from the outside and the in side, looked a bit like it might have been haunted. Still though, it was cosy, in it’s own right. Daniel decided to turn on the radio, and listen to some music. He argued that he deserved a break. He would continue his detective work tomorrow. In the bag which he took from the hiding spot, he found the bottles of alcohol. They hadn’t been opened yet. Daniel decided that one drink had never hurt anyone. He woke up the next morning, laying on the ground, with an enormous headache. One of the two bottles was laying next to him on the ground, shattered, in a puddle of the liquid it was supposed to be holding. Daniel was happy that nobody he knew was there at that point; he was very much ashamed of himself. He drank some water, and looked for something to clean the glass with. His headache was killing him, so he was also looking to find some painkillers. He thought to himself: why did you have to do this to yourself? Then he noticed he was bleeding on his arm. He must have hurt himself with the glass shards. He decided to look at that first. He cleaned up the wounds on his arm. There were some small glass shards in his arms, but it didn’t look too serious. He cleaned them up, and used some of the ‘verband’ he found to fix himself up. After that, he cleaned up the mess he had made. He then ate some food to get his stomach to stop being upset, and sat down outside. He was still having a major headache, and therefor just took a rest for a couple of hours. After his headache subsided, he looked through the piles of paper that were laying around in the house. He wanted to see if there was somewhere he could look further. Some place he could look for further clues on where Violet and the Innkeeper had gone. He found a note, it said something about a spot near the ministry of education, journalism department. There would be a small bench there, and people would sit down there to transfer information. He wasn’t sure if there was anyone there who would be interesting to meet, but he didn’t see much harm in trying. So, he went on his way there. His body half protested the movement, but was also happy to get some fresh air. He found the bench without much effort. There weren’t many people nearby; the area was mostly populated by birds. The birds didn’t really seem to mind his presence, and walked down very close to him. Daniel closed his eyes and listened to the world around him. He could hear people walk by, he could hear the birds chirping. He could hear the noise of a cart being pulled over an uneven roadbed. Of people in the distance haggling about a price. In general, what he heard was life. Because, even with all the shit going on with the Outer Shards, it seemed that life was still continuing. There was obviously less of it than when he left, a few months ago, but the place was still living. It’s not that people died of hunger (yet), but more that people are a bit less lively. They, for the most part, feel a bit down about the fact that the life conditions have deteriorated quite substantially. Daniel let his thoughts slip, and almost didn’t notice that someone sat down next to him.  The mysterious person said “Hi”. Daniel said nothing back. The person continued: “What brings you here? You’re not one of the people who usually visits this place.”. Daniel said: “I was friends with people who referred me to this bench. I lost track of them a few months ago, and I guess they didn’t fare well since.”. The man replied: “You’re going to have to be more specific.”. Daniel sighed. “I was in contact with Violet and #name. They went into hiding some time ago. After that, I lost track of where they were. They must have gone elsewhere at some point. I wondered if you knew where they had gone.”. The mysterious man said: “I don’t know where they are, but I might know who would know.

            <Title>Scene 5 - Doomsday</Title>
            <Text>Within every group, there’s people who want a more extreme version of what the group wants. Daniel was never that person. However, now that he lost almost everything, he didn’t really feel like continuing the struggle like it was. He got a feeling that if he were to lose everything, he didn’t see why others could keep it. So, he was looking for a way to prevent the Capital from winning. The Capital had threatened with weapons that would be able to destroy shards whole. So far, only once has such a weapon been used. Daniel hoped he would be able to find a few of those somewhere in the Capital still. With his new-found skill, he might just be able to sneak in and force the bomb to explode inside the Capital. This would mean having to figure out where those bombs were actually produced and stored. Without that vital information, there would be no way to execute this plan. There were two weapons factory that Daniel knew about. One was on the East Docks shard. This shard had been named after the fact that it used to be part of a Docks region in the city from before the event that was used as the base of the Capital. The East Docks were a restricted area; only people with high clearance, and workers for that area were permitted onto it. It contained multiple big #loodsen which could easily be used to produce such weapons. It also had a big bridge connecting it to one of the airfields. The airfields were also still military-only. The idea had apparently been to also use the Gliders for non-military use, but, so far, only one non-military mission was flown with them. This had been a research mission, placing sensors near the centre of the energy storm that the Capital was hovering in. After that, with the rebellion and other conflicts, the Gliders had only been used military. Since weapons of mass destruction would either have to be transported by Glider, or have to be launched on a pad similar to a Glider’s launch pad, Daniel reasoned that the East Docks was the only logical location to build such weapons. It would also be far enough away from the important parts of the Capital that an explosion would not do major damage. 
So, if the weapon was indeed there, Daniel would, preferably, have to launch it towards the rest of the Capital. Alternatively, it would have to explode just as it crossed the bridge. Since the gravity forces there would be much lower, the explosion would spread much further, causing major damage to some of the more central shards as well. Daniel hoped this could damage the Capital in a very disruptive way. This, combined with the lack of logistic capabilities, would possibly damage the Capital beyond repair. What made this even more insane is that the West Docks, next to the East Docks shard, contained most of the food storage for the Capital. So, an explosion near there could set fire to the food storage in the Capital. 
Daniel arrived at the East Docks in the early afternoon. Indeed, there was a security gate. The fences around the place were quite tall. There was a proper security peremiter. Daniel would, normally, have no chance to enter here without a permit, or considerable force. He had neither. However, he hoped he could sneak into the place by strategically slowing down time to a halt. He could either add his own name to the list of expected guests, or just try to sneak past. He decided to just try his powers, focussing on wanting time to slow down. He didn’t really know how to do so, and then remembered that he just should want something to be possible. So, he tried being past the gate, near the entrance, on a bench. It took quite some focus, but, suddenly and to his own surprise, he was suddenly sitting on the bench. He was out of breath by it, possibly because he had to run so fast. Suddenly though, he was past the first security checkpoint. He hoped that after this, the security would be more lenient, presuming that if he was let in here, that he would be permitted to be here. He stood up, and walked towards the entrance to a building whose sign said ‘Main assembly hall’. Sounds good, Daniel thought. There was a main entrance, with to guards standing next to it. However, there was also a loading dock. It was closed, but the door was locked with a keypad. Six keys were discolored compared to the rest. Since they all had a similar discolouring, Daniel assumed that every digit would be in the code once. Normally, trying all the permutations of six different digits would take quite some time. Although knowing which six digits these are, that’s still 720 different options to try. However, Daniel hoped his powers could be of help here. They weren’t. He couldn’t envision the final situation, so he couldn’t fasten the process. Still, 720 combinations only took him around ten minutes. After that, he was in. He was happy no alarm seemed to have been triggered by his multiple attempts. He was suddenly standing inside the main hall. It had quite a few people working there, with cranes overhead moving bigger parts of the things in there. There were a few missiles standing there, seemingly ready to be deployed. There weren’t any guards in this area. It must have been presumed that, if someone got in here, he or she is permitted to be in here. Daniel thought about the current situation for a moment. He realised there was very little chance of him being able to find something to sabotage of the rockets without alarming anyone, while people were working there. Therefore, he should find a spot to hide until the workers have mostly left. After that, he might be able to find something to cause the rockets to explode before they could be deployed. He found a small broom closet that didn’t look like it was used very often. He sat down in a corner, waiting for people to leave the place. It would still be a few hours before that would finally happen. If there wasn’t such a thing as night shifts here. Daniel sure hoped not, otherwise he would not be able to do this thing. After a very long wait, Daniel heard someone lock the doors. He assumed he would have the place to his own from now on. He was correct in this assumption; only he and the rockets were still there. What he first wanted to look at were the schematics. He would need to know mostly how the rocket knew when to explode. Manipulating this part would be a trivial way to get it to explode before that. He found some blueprints of the rockets in a small office connected to the main assembly hall. The rockets had two computers inside them. They would have to agree on a decision, otherwise the decision would not be made. This was to prevent early explosions due to technical problems in the computers. It was seen as better to not explode at all than to explode early. Daniel looked for the technical description of the computer systems. There should be some information about them specifically. He found a service manual for those machines. It said something about a test mode. In test mode, the computer would not verify that the other computer agreed, and just go to firing. This would mean only one computer would have to be sabotaged. For instance, changing the conditions in which it should explode could be enough. Daniel looked up the explosion conditions. It used a distance sensor on the nose of the rocket, and if the target was within five hundred meters, the rocket would explode. This, unless it hadn’t flied for more than a minute; in the first minute it would assume something had gone wrong instead of exploding. So, both these conditions would have to be circumvented. Although Daniel had no experience with computers, he did have some common sense. He knew that a rocket would need a way to keep track of a minute. Now, it wouldn’t need to be extremely precise; there was quite a margin between the minute passing and reaching the target. The idea was more that one minute would be enough to clear away from whatever launched the rocket.

So, to make the rocket explode early, it would have to be convinced that a minute had passed already since launch, and that it was near it’s destination. Actually, Daniel could see from the design, it could just be modified to *always* think it was at it’s destination. The programming, according to the document, didn’t care about continuously being at it’s destination, and would then just sit out the time, waiting for the right moment to blow up. So, all Daniel would really need to think about is how to trick it into thinking a minute had passed. Technology had evolved quite a bit, but not an extreme lot yet. Basically, the minute was timed by burning through a bit of wire. After it burned through, the circuit would no longer be complete, and the rocket would explode if it was near the target. Actually, there were four of such wires, and all four would need to be burned through. Daniel cut all four of them almost entirely through. It was good enough to make the rocket pass the self-test before launch, but not better than necessary to pass the test. This would mean the rocket would not fly for longer than a few seconds before exploding, short enough to still be on whatever location it would be at that point. The rockets seemed to be much too big to be hanged under a glider, so the rocket would have to be launched from a platform somewhere. Also, according to the design, the first stage of the rocket didn’t bring it’s own oxygen, so it would need to be launched from an oxiginated environment. Therefore, it would stand to reason that the rocket would probably be launched from the Capital. And, with all the safety measures in place, there would not really be a reason to presume it wouldn’t be safe to launch it from the Capital. Daniel decided to sabotage only one of the rockets, the rest he left like the regular design. He assumed there would be a checkup of whatever would be left of the rest of the rockets, so he didn’t want to sabotage them, at least not in the same way. He hoped the rest of the rockets would explode as well, through the fire caused by the first rocket, but he wasn’t sure about that. He didn’t understand the payload well enough to know if that would happen. It might need the trigger to explode at all, not even reacting when fire is present nearby. 
Daniel admired his work for a while, and then decided to leave. Before leaving though, he made two small lines on two of the drawings, hoping to cause some confusion to the people building the next rocket. If nothing else, it made him feel happy about it. 
After that, he looked for a spot to wait for the night to be over. He would not be permitted to leave the place yet; he would be in trouble if he tried to cross the gate. 
Four hours later, people started to flow into the place again. Daniel therefore thought it would be time for him to leave soon. He thought he should wait a bit longer, so more people had crossed the gate. Before that, it would be suspicious if he left, and, besides, they would have remembered who had entered that day. Before he could easily leave though, a cleaning person spotted him there. In a split second, he answered: “Oh, I dropped some coffee, and I was looking for a towel or something to remove the stain.”. “The towels are laying in the bin over there”, she said, not entirely sure if he was speaking the truth. He took two, and went on his way. From here on, he did apply his skill to quickly get from one hidden place to the next. He didn’t want to get spotted again; not everyone would be as gullible as the cleaning lady. He found the lavatories, and hid in one of them. He reasoned that nobody would really notice that one of eight lavatories was out of use. The lavatories smelled of chloride, so it looked like the cleaning staff had already visited it. After a few minutes, he relaxed. He felt like he could stay there until he had found the right time to leave. 
After thinking about it for a while more, he came to the conclusion that he should probably leave  around the time when the first shift leaves. Two shifts were working in the factory, with the nightly block having nobody work there. He calculated that the shift would be over at around 15:00, three hours from now. He was properly bored, but couldn’t do much about it. In the end, he fell asleep.

He had another strange dream. A voice was telling him : “What you just did will kill everyone in the Capital, as well as the Outer Shards. The cascade from the explosion, and retaliation will leave nobody alive.”. Daniel asked : “So, you want me to disable the bombs?”. “No point”, the voice said, with a stern #overtuiging. “You already set the chain in motion. What you can try to do is to get some people to be on the far-side of the furthest-away shards of the Capital. Those should stay safe from the blast, and they would survive the blast. The next launch will be in 30 hours, and they will bring three rockets to the launch platform. Two of the rockets will explode because of your manipulations, the third one will stay intact. The explosion will set most of the Capital on fire, besides instantly destroying a fair bit of it. These rockets were already strong as single units; designed to destroy a shard. Exploding two near eachother was never even considered when they were designed.”. Daniel said: “So, you’re asking me to look for some people, and tell them they should stand at that spot, otherwise they will blow up?”. “Yes, that’s what I’m saying. Maybe don’t tell them exactly that though. What I know is that everyone not outside the blast radius will die a horrible death.”. Daniel thought about this for a moment. He thought about who he would want to save. He thought about saving his girlfriend and son. It would save their lives, but it wouldn’t mean much at all. He thought about saving the mysterious man near the bench. He didn’t know, nor trust the guy. He thought about going to the strange house near the Inn, and to see if there were still people there. He didn’t go back there, because he didn’t want to risk him being followed, and therefore causing them trouble. But, he guessed, if they were following him, they would have stopped him before entering the base. Therefore, they probably weren’t following him. Or, if they were, they were doing so terribly. Daniel thought it might have been that his special powers caused them to lose his trail. If that was indeed the case, he should take some effort to stay somewhat hidden. 
He woke up, and felt like some time had passed. A few minutes later, he heard someone say: shift is over, can’t wait to go home. So, Daniel left the toilet, and blended into the big mess of people walking there. He thought he would blend into the group, causing nobody to notice he hadn’t worked there before. One person tried to start a conversation: “So, what are you going to do, now that you’re done with work for today?”. Daniel was surprised, but answered regardless: “Oh, I’m gonna visit an old friend. We haven’t spoken in a while.”. This was technically almost the truth. It just hinged on the word friend being rather loosely defined. However, since all Daniel’s friends were out of reach, he might as well consider the few people that were still in the Capital and didn’t provably hate him his friends. Daniel continued: “What about you?”. The guy said: “Oh, you know, just gonna listen to some radio, take a smoke and some wisky.”. “Mmmm, whisky”, Daniel replied. He felt himself get thirsty for it. He nodded to the guy and they passed through the gate. No questions were asked to the people that left. It wouldn’t make much sense if they were, since they had all entered the area legitimately. Still, it made leaving nice and easy for Daniel. 
Daniel walked towards the shard with the Inn. He paid attention to the orientations of shards. This shard would be one of the shards where some areas would survive. They were outside the direct blast radius, and the backside would not be hit by the heat wave either. From what he could see, the inn would be survivable, but most of the regular houses wouldn’t be. A lot of them were straight in the line of the heatwave. The backside of the shard had a park, and some other buildings. It wasn’t as densely built on, because this is quite a remote shard, and therefore some space was kept empty for people to enjoy some free space. The Capital wanted to provide everyone with enough space to also live, but, of course, space was still at a premium here, especially in the more central regions of the Capital. To prevent having to deal with the tiny housing in the center of the Capital, Daniel and his girlfriend had moved a bit out of the central set of Shards. It was a somewhat more shabby neighbourhood, but it meant, at the very least, that they were able to afford a decent amount of space for a decent price. And besides, the area they lived in wasn’t too terrible. It had nice children’s playgrounds, lots of families with children, and only a few criminal scum. They had been quite happy with the amount of space they had gotten there, and were trying to make the most of it. Still, the shard with the Inn on it trumped most other shards when it came to space. The shard had been added with the intent of filling in the green area, but when it was added, the Council noticed the green area was really enjoyed by the population of the Capital, and therefore they decided not to fill it in. They had planned to build a new highrise building there, the first one to be built for residential use since the Event. All the other high rises in the Capital had been retrofits of existing buildings. So that was the reason that this specific shard did not have that much on it. It was remote, and it wasn’t fully developed to what it was intended to be developed as. To some extent the project had been a flop. It barely gained back the cost of building a bridge to it. It had some housing capacity, sure, but it didn’t bring much to the Capital besides that. The Inn was just about the only thing of interest on that shard, and that inn wasn’t the most luxerious; It was actually notorious for being a place of trouble. However, the locals of this shard liked it that way. They didn’t like the clean types of entertainment that were preferred for most of the rest of the Capital. They liked drinking booze of questionable quality, and, after being properly drunk, to give in to their anger, and go for a nice and proper bar fight. This is why most of the interior of this bar looked like it had been repaired hastily after having been smashed; most of the interior had indeed been smashed.
Daniel arrived on said shard, and looked for the building with the #color door. He found it after not much effort, and knocked. The same lady as before opened the door. Daniel said “Hi, I have something important to tell you.”. She looked surprised, not really remembering who he was. He said: “Oh, right. I’m Daniel, I’ve been here once before, I was working together with Violet and the others. I’ve lost touch with them, and hoped you could help.”. She said: “I don’t remember you. I don’t know what you are talking about.”. Behind her was a little girl. The girl had also been there last time, but Daniel hadn’t paid much attention to her. Last time, she didn’t say much, or otherwise do anything to grab attention.  The girl said: “Hey, Daniel, have you seen Violet? I haven’t seen her for a while.”. Daniel said: “No, I haven’t. I lost contact with her, and with her friends. Do you know where her friends would be?”. The girl looked at the staircase, and was about to say something, when the woman said: “No, stay silent, this man isn’t a nice man.”. The girl said: “But, last time he was friendly. He looks like he could help.”. The woman said: “You’re saying much too much.”. She switched her attention to Daniel: “I don’t know what you think you are to find here, but there’s nothing here that could be of use to you.”. Daniel said: “Okay. Just one thing, please take care that you are on the park-side of this shard in the afternoon in two days. I can’t explain why, but please just do.”. The girl asked: “Will there be a picknick?”. Daniel said: “Something like that. It’s very important that you do that. Can you please also invite Violet’s friends? Don’t tell anyone else though, it has to stay a secret. If you tell anyone, and they tell some people, and that continues, then everyone will be at the park. And that would not fit in the park, would it? ”. The woman said: “I don’t understand what you’re talking about, but you seem sincere. Why is this so important?”. Daniel said: “It will be clear at some point. Before that point arises, I can’t explain it better than I have. It’s extremely important. Also, if you somehow do visit them, even though you don’t know them, could you please tell them that Daniel is looking for them, and will be at the benches on the other side of this shard tomorrow at midday.”. She nodded.

The next day at midday, Daniel was already sitting on one of the benches. It wasn’t a busy day; the park was mostly devoid of people. This park was mostly crowded in weekends, not really on weekdays. The people in this region had to work full workdays, which, in the Capital, meant five days of nine hours - nine times five. Thus, not many people would have time in the middle of the day to go to a park. One person showed up. Daniel recognised him immediately, #name had a particular way of walking. Something about the way he walked just always seemed to be a tad strange, without it being really clear what it was that was strange. Daniel said: “I suppose you want to know what’s going on, and why I asked for such a strange thing.”. #name said: “Something big is going to happen tomorrow, isn’t it?”. Daniel said: “Yes, something enormous. Something that will tip over the Capital, resetting the power structure in this region for good.”. #name replied: “And a lot of people will suffer or die because of it. Will it be worth it?”. Daniel said: “I sure hope so, it’s the final move in the conflict that has been going on for months.”. #name looked in the distance. He didn’t seem convinced by Daniels words. He tried again: “Did you weigh the damage you’re doing against the goals you’re achieving? It seems the price will be rather high, what do you hope to get in return?”. Daniel said: “A chance to do right this time, a new start. It will give people the chance to think about what they want. With the right steering, we can build a beautiful world, one where the power structure is more flat.”. #name sighed, and answered: “But what makes you believe that it will turn out better this time? Is it the fact that you are the one starting it? Or is there actually something that makes it different this time? I hope you have thought this trough, because we’re gonna go through hell soon.”. Daniel said: “I thought about it a lot, but you’re right, it will not be comfortable.”. #name said: “Ah well, nothing to be done about it. Should I warn the others that they should group themselves here as well?”. Daniel said: “Yes, but do it in such a way that the message doesn’t spread too much. Or, if you’re going to spread it, do it so late in the timeline that the leaders of the Capital don’t have time to leave. Otherwise it will achieve the opposite, only hurting the lower classes in the Capital, and not the main leaders.”. #name said: “That makes sense. You wouldn’t want to hurt those who were only serving to begin with. I’ll tell the others, and tell them to not tell their family what’s going on, just that they are going on a pick nick in the park. They should be able to convince them without much effort. Do we have to discuss more? I still have lots of things to do for tomorrow.”. Daniel said: “Not really, besides that we should try to get some stuff hidden away here, so we have some materials in store here. I can arrange preliminary amounts of food, water and some weapons even. That should be enough to last us through the first few days, but I don’t know what the food state will be beyond tomorrow.”.

The rest of the day, Daniel was collecting the items he thought would be useful for past the explosions. He arranged quite some food, as well as a decent supply of water. He stole some weapons from an army depot. It was supposed to be locked, but he was able to sneak by when someone entered. He waited for the night to set in a bit, and looked for a spot to hide the stuff in the park when the night had fallen. He found a nice spot hidden under a strangely located rock. Little by little, he moved the items there, thus ensuring some stuff would be immediately available after the explosions. He then just looked for a spot somewhere to lay down and relax. He found a nice grassy patch in the park, and looked up at the sky. The sky was cloudy and black, but it didn’t look like it would rain. The sky was always cloudy and black, but rain looked different here. Daniel closed his eyes, and fell asleep.

He dreamt again, this time he only dreamt of darkness. There was nothing there, only darkness. Then, suddenly, the darkness was on fire. There wasn’t just fire in the darkness, everything was darkness, and that everything was on fire. There aren’t really words to describe the situation, but to Daniel this was the truth within this dream. Then, suddenly, he was standing on a bridge. The darkness had shifted colors, now it was of gray-ish tint, with concentric circular patterns of light in it. It looked like it was full of some strange sort of energy. If he didn’t know better, he would have said it looked magical. One of the colored vortices was almost on the ground. Interesting, Daniel thought, the ground didn’t exist a while ago. Now it was a rocky ground, like some of the uninhabited shards. The ground was sharp and uneven, but otherwise not that horrible to stand on. It had a strange silvery color, but wasn’t really glinstering; it was quite faded. 
Daniel walked towards the circle that was near ground level. He hesitated for a bit, and then touched it carefully with his hand. His hand felt full of a sort of warmth he had never felt before. It radiated through his body. In a way, it felt like he was burning, but he didn’t feel like he was burning. Instead, he was just feeling charged up with some strange kind of energy. He moved his hand out of it, and saw it was giving off a strange kind of light. Still unsure what was going on, he tried to shake it off, but the light stayed there. Daniel thought: fuck it, it’s only a dream, what’s the worst that could happen, and stepped through. Before he could see where he would end up though, he woke up.

Daniel must have slept quite long, because it was already quite light when he stood up. He at least had a nice long rest before the terror would start, so that was something.
He figured he still had a few hours before the explosion would occur. After eating breakfast, he suddenly felt his thoughts move towards his ex-girlfriend and son. Could he really just let them die in the explosion? He didn’t think he could live with that. He decided to throw caution in the wind, and warn them. He ran as fast as he could towards their appartment. He rang the doorbell, not wanting to just break into his old home. He didn’t know if they would have changed the keys, but didn’t think it would be nice to do so. A man unknown to him opened the door. “Hi”, Daniel said, awkwardly. “Hi”, the man said, in a low, dismissive tone. Daniel didn’t feel welcomed. He wasn’t. “What’s your business here”, the man growled. Daniel replied: “I would like to speak with #girlfriend, if you don’t mind.”. “And what if I do mind”, the man asked. Daniel sighed, and said: “Look, I have something important to tell her.”. The man said: “You can tell me what it’s about, then I can ask her if she wants to talk to you.”. Daniel replied: “Tell her Daniel is here, and wants to talk with her about something very important. Look, I know how this looks, but do you relaly think I would not be here if it wasn’t important? I know, she’s yours, my chance has passed. It’s just I have to relay a message to her. After that, I’m gone here again.”. The man shouted into the home: “Honey, there’s a strange man here. He calls himself Daniel, and says it’s important.”. She looked through the door opening, and said: “You have some guts, coming back here after all that you’ve done. You know through how much hell I had to go, because you decided to be a terrorist? They were after everything, our home, our livelyhood, our status. You nearly destroyed my entire life. Is this what you wanted to do for your child? Is this your idea of being a good parent? You could have had it all, but you threw it out. I never wanted to see you again, why are you even here? “. Daniel said: “I understand, I fucked it up. I can tell you the story, but it would not matter, because the result is still the same, I choose for the rebels, or terrorists as you call them, instead of you. I’m sorry for that.”. “You’re sorry? Really? That’s what you’re going for? What do you expect now? A trophy? An ‘it’s OK’?”, she was furious, although she was still seemingly calm. He said: “No. I just wanted to say something, because I thought it was important.”. She said: “Well, say it. I don’t particularly care about speaking with you, and have better things to do.”. He said: “Something is about to happen, and you may want to be on one of the far-outer shards of the Capital. If so, try to be on the side facing away from the centre.”. She said: “And we’re supposed to do that, just from your word? The word of a terrorist? What’s going to happen? Why are you telling us this?”. Daniel said: “I can’t tell you why I know this. I just know it. I shouldn’t have told you this to begin with, but I thought I would warn you. Now I’m not sure if I should have ever come here.”. She answered: “Finally something we can agree on. Anyway, we don’t need your advice or your help. We’re perfectly fine here. We won’t be listening to you and your terrorist friends. Please, leave.”. Daniel said: “Ok, I just needed to try.”. She asked: “Is that for us, or for your own conscience?”. Daniel said: “I thought it was for you, but I see that it may have been a mistake to come here.”. She nodded. 
Daniel returned to the park; #name, #woman and #girl showed up a bit later, with five people of entourage. Just as they had all settled down a bit, they heard a loud bang in the background. The shard trembled. They could see buildings arround them shake of the force of the blow. Then they heard and felt it there as well. The blast was incredibly loud, almost shattering the eardrums of the people in the park. When they looked around after it, they saw that quite a few buildings around had collapsed. One of them had caught fire. Then, when the wave settled down, they heard the people. There were faint noises of pain coming from quite a few directions. Daniel signalled to wait for a little bit. He was right; suddenly, there was a second loud bang. It wasn’t as loud as the previous one; it sounded less controlled. The wave was less strong, but it was still the second one. Everything had already had a hit, so a lot of buildings  and other structures were already damaged. Therefore, this softer blow was perceived as doing a lot more damage. After it went over, the number of voices of pain had lowered significantly. They waited for one more minute, after which they decided that it was probably safe to look for people to help. Daniel walked towards a residential building, because he heard a scream coming out of it. It sounded like the person still had some strength left, so he thought he might stand a chance. When he arrived at the building, he saw that it had partly collapsed. The person was stuck in the middle of the rubble.Daniel looked up before entering the building. It looked like it could collapse at any moment. Still, he felt like he had to  step in and help. This was on his hands. So, he walked in there. He saw someone laying on the ground, with a leg trapped underneath a big metal cabinet. Daniel tried putting his weight under it, but didn’t immediately achieve success. He therefore looked around for something he could use as a lever. By using a metal beam he found, he tried lifting the cabinet. This time he was succesful. The man whose leg was stuck under there let out a scream, but then managed to move his leg out of there. The leg looked really bad, it was in a very unnatural corner; it had obviously been broken. After seeing the leg had cleared the cabinet’s area, Daniel slowly let the cabinet drop back to it’s spot on the ground. Then, he went to help the man. He supported him on the side with the broken leg, and helped him get out of the building. Just mere minutes later, the building collapsed under it’s own weight. Daniel didn’t feel much need to feel joyful; for a lot of people, this wouldn’t happen this luckily. This was his fault. Also, now there was the situation where someone with a broken leg that needed help would need to find help somewhere. They might be able to at least support it a bit, provided they find the correct materials. Daniel sweared at himself for not thinking to take medical stuff. He was very much annoyed at himself for not thinking to arrange that. He could have known they would run into situations where people would be hurt.The others also managed to pick up two more wounded people. After that, it was silent. Daniel assumed this was largely because most people had been at work, so the actual number of people here would be relatively low. After they regrouped, Daniel took the word. “As you noticed, there have been some explosions, which did extensive damage to this area. It wasn’t just here, most of the Capital suffered from this. This is actually one of the spots with lower damage, the centre has it much worse. You may wonder what could have caused this. In the conflict with the Outer Shards, the Capital was deploying massive bombs, which were supposed to launch from a platform within the Capital. These explosions were intended for the Outer Shards. Intervention by me caused them to explode here instead. So, I’m responsible for this chaos. However, I thought this would be better than having the Outer Shards get blown up. I felt like the Capital was more to blame for it than the Outer Shards, and that these weapons were not fair towards the Outer Shards. I wanted to level the playing field. Mind you, two of these rockets were already deployed against the Outer Shards.”. One of the new persons said : “Excuse me, but who are you? You’re telling me you killed thousands of people, but that’s OK, because of strange reasons? Why, if you had access to the bombs, didn’t you just make them not fire? Or why didn’t you make them loose their navigational trajectory?”. Daniel: “You weren’t there, a month ago, when the first of these missiles hit the main city of the Outer Shards. Men, woman, children, all dieing in one load of smoke. I lost two dear friends in that explosion. When I saw they were making more of those bombs, I felt like they had to be stopped.”. The man said: “You could have told us though? You could have explained the violence that had happened there. You could have explained what you were fighting for and why.”. Daniel: “There was no proof. I had absolutely no proof, not even of the weapons existence. Nobody would have believed me. My options were: letting the Capital murder all of my friends, or doing something like this. I felt like this was the fairer option.”. The man screamed out: “You killed my wife and my children. You’re a monster to even think like this. Why are you OK with yourself with doing this?”. Daniel said: “I don’t know. Perhaps it’s the fact that the conflict didn’t catch up with me yet. Perhaps I’m desensitised to the violence that’s going on.”. The man sighed. He looked defeated, and said softly: “Ah well, we’ll have to deal with the results of it now. I just hope it will turn out to be worth it.”. Daniel said nothing in return.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 6 - Apocalypse Yesterday</Title>
            <Text>Whatever Daniel had expected to get in return for the bombs that exploded, the initial result wasn’t what he had hoped. It was mostly people scraping by for survival. The initial few days had been all about trying to find people that were still alive, and finding more resources for immediate survival. After that, there was a little stockpile of food, and some basic necessities, such as some bandages, basic medicines, etc. It would be enough for a couple of weeks, given the current population. This meant that, quite soon, farming would have to start. Since some potatoes were found, they were put into the ground almost immediately. The park was turned into farming land, bit by bit. With a current population of around thirty-five, the park would, if producing at full capacity, be just about enough for the food for everyone. However, it would not be possible to start up full-scale production directly. There weren’t enough potatoes around to put into the ground. It was decided not to waste any of them by eating them, arguing that they would be more useful if multiplied. If hunger was going to happen, might as well have it happen earlier in the cycle, such was the idea. Also, they were thinking that new food might still be found in the early times after the explosion. Besides farming, half of the remaining population was put on scavenging, with the rest put on repairs. The idea was to have at least some nice housing done. It was the warmer period of the year. The cold-period would not be extremely cold, but having somewhat insulated homes would go a long way towards preventing people from getting sick. It would also mean people would have to eat less, since they could keep themselves warm.
The scavenging groups were doing a great job. Their basic task was to go through houses and find food and other useful items. They were also tasked with trying to find other people that survived. Mostly though, they came across dead people. The shard still had one connecting bridge still standing, which connected it to another Shard. That shard was in an a lot less great shape. Most buildings had collapsed, the debris blocking some of the roads on there. For the first few days, there had still been fires there, but they had run out of things to burn, so now they went cold. Slowly, but certainly, the survivors were expanding their territory. They were hoping to find canned food, or other food that could have survived the fires. It turned out that tin cans in cellars were actually quite often still okay, to the surprise of many. Fires apparently didn’t really go down into the cellar that often, flames mostly go up.
Over the next few weeks, scavenging results were dropping day-by-day. The teams needed to head out further and further away, because the parts nearby had already been scavenged. This meant the territory got more inhospitable, as well as the walk itself becoming longer and longer. And, since the path wasn’t easy to clear, most of it was kept in a state full of random stuff.

When the winter came, they had enough food. It was cold, dreadful, and generally not a nice period, but they were able to get through it. The new reality became increasingly livable. Plus, with this small group, decisions were actually made by involving everyone. There were no secrets, not anymore. Everyone was involved with everything, had a say in everything, and was happy like this. As the food supplies increased, so did everyone’s happiness. The old adage that food is the first important thing to give people still holds, especially after a major disaster. Daniel sat down on one of the benches, and relaxed. He felt like things were moving forward. The price had been terribly high, but it looked like, now at least, there was improvement. There was no inequality anymore; everyone just worked to their best ability, and took what they needed. Greed seemed to have made way for kindness and a mentality of sharing. Daniel wondered though if there had been other groups of people that had survived the explosion, and how they would be doing. He hoped the same thing that had happened here happened in other places as well. 
A few weeks later, they figured out that it hadn’t. During one of their scavenging trips, they saw a small group of people in the distance. They proceeded with caution, seeing that they were armed. Staying hidden, Daniel and the rest of this group had a view over the situation. Three guys armed with crowbars walked towards a person who was partially hidden. The person screamed, as she was pushed on the ground. They said something to her. When she said no, they bashed her head in with the crowbar. Daniel and the others decided they had seen enough, and slowly retreated. They would have to decide together with the rest how to deal with this situation. They hadn’t really considered what to do if they met people who didn’t hold the same values as themselves. Daniel guessed though that the only options would then be to either ignore them, or actively fight them. He hoped his group was the only group that had found weapons so far, but wasn’t sure. Most of the weapons were stored in facilities quite near the site of the explosion, so they were cut off from the rest of the Capital now; the bridges connecting that area had all been destroyed. It would only take one fool with a gun to kill one of the thirty-five people here. They hadn’t had to bury anyone since the event, and weren’t planning to have to do so any time soon. A military conflict was therefore not something they could really afford to do. Life simply was too valuable now, especially the lives of the people where; the ones believing in progress. 
When they returned, a meeting was scheduled for that evening. Everyone was to be present, because this was information that was important for everyone. That evening, everyone was waiting to figure out what they had been summoned for. They had decided to wait with the message until the meeting, so everyone would know at the same time. Well, the people on the mission would know before that, of course, but there was no way to stop that. Daniel took the word: “Hi all, you may wonder why this meeting was summoned. As you may know, we were on a mission to scavenge for food. However, we ran into other survivors. After looking at what they were doing, we saw that they had not chosen the same path that we had, instead choosing for violence and individualism. We witnessed someone get brutally murdered, because she wouldn’t give them what they asked for. So, we either have to fight there, or can’t really progress in that direction. I would like to hear your opinions on this. I wouldn’t make a decision on it tonight though, because this is too important to come to a rushed conclusion.”. #Hank, one of the other survivors was looking thoughtfully. He had been an engineer before the explosion. He was working on fixing the plumbing of a house when the explosion happened. It had caused the building to come down, trapping one of his legs underneath the rubble. He had survived, but the leg broke, and during the healing it had become a few centimetres longer than the other leg. This gave him a bit of a limb. Other than that, he was physically perfectly in order. He was a thoughtful person, always trying to figure out what option would be the best for everyone. He scratched his voice, and said: “We should consider the people living in that world. I would guess that a lot of them don’t want to live like that. They would much rather live in a society that supports them. So, for as far as we can, we should try to support some of them.”. Julia, a former …, answered: “But, we have to consider the risks we’re taking. By allowing them to know we exist we start to be under permanent threat. If they use that kind of violence, we could take serious damage here. The question is: how much risk are we willing to take to help others?”. Daniel said: “Indeed. It’s our safety against their safety, or even their life. Quite a few people there may not be wanting the situation there. Is it fair to keep them in the current situation, just so we can stay a bit safer? We have plenty of food and other things.”. #Hank replied: “The question is: do we think that’s important enough to risk our own safety. I suggest we vote on that.”. Everyone agreed to this notion.
The next day, they held a vote. It was almost entirely in the middle, but, a majority decided in the end on helping the people outside the group. After this vote, some voices were raised to start putting people as look-outs through the night. This would mean that they would be able to defend their territory at least a bit. 
 
They find some people, and add them to the group.

Daniel woke up to a smell of fire. He stretched his muscles, and walked outside, looking where the smell was coming from. It was the farm, and it wasn’t just a small fire either. There were flames everywhere on the farm, meters high, engulfing the entire harvest. More people were streaming onto the area next to the farm, all looking in horror at the burning farmland. The fire engulfed had already destroyed all the food. Since the areas around it were concrete, there was no point in trying to take out the fire; it would only lead to a bigger mess, and a loss of water. Therefore, they just did nothing, staring at the fire. It was obvious to everyone that this wasn’t an accident. Plants simply don’t burn this heavily. Someone purposely set this all on fire. Someone did not want them to have food, to thrive, or even to survive. Someone just tore their future apart. They just stood there, in horror, and disbelief, as the fire ate their food in minutes; the food that was supposed to last them for months. 
After the fire had stopped burning, and the ground had cooled down a bit, they started to look for food that had survived, as well as clues to what could have happened. They knew almost certainly that it was arson, but who had done it was still a mystery. There was a conflict starting to grow within the group; some of the original members felt like the people they took in from elsewhere could have been responsible for the fire. Still though, this didn’t really make sense to Daniel, as these people would be just as dependant on this food as they would have been. After looking at the farm a bit, they realised they hadn’t seen the nightly watch keepers yet, and might want to speak to them. The switch of guard duties would be in an hour or so, which would be a natural moment to start asking questions. #Hank asked the people present who they thought should speak with the night’s guard. Daniel said: “I think I should go.”. Two more people joined him, both wearing weapons. They walked towards the bridge, where they saw that the two people that had been guarding it were no longer at their posts. They found them bound to the pillars of the bridge, unconscious. This gave them some idea of what had happened. There were some signs of a struggle, and their weapons were absent. 

Since the farm had gone, the survivors had no choice but to push further into the city, looking for food to scavenge. They tried their best to prevent getting into conflicts with other groups, but in some cases they couldn’t help it. This meant that, sometimes, people got hurt. Not just their enemies would get hurt, within two months, the number of survivors had dropped from fourty (thirty-five plus five more) to thirtytwo. It became increasingly obvious that the situation would not be sustainable. There was an attempt at restarting the farm, but it was going quite slow. There just weren’t that many potatoes and other crops to start the farm with, so the harvests were rather low. Besides this, it was still winter season, so the cold didn’t help them either. It became increasingly clear that the choice would end up being between survival and war. And nobody here wanted to make that choice.

Daniel had another strange dream. This time, there wasn’t just a voice; there was also a body that went with it. It looked human, but illuminated. The character said: “Hi Daniel, nice to see you again, although I wish it would have been under better circumstances.”. Daniel said: “You were right, I’m sorry about it.”. The character said: “You weren’t wrong, you were just too optimistic about people. You can hardly be blamed for that.”. Daniel said: “But I’ve doomed them all, nobody will survive.”. The character changed shape a bit, and somehow looked quite a bit more friendly. It said: “Yes, and no. There is still an option. Whether you want to choose it or not is up to you.”. Daniel said: “What options could possibly be left? We have two options: either to die of starvation, or to die fighting each other.”. The voice said: “There is always a third option.”. Daniel said: “What other option is there, besides suicide?”. The character said: “Well, calling it suicide would be calling it the end. However, what if it wasn’t the end?”. Daniel said: “You’re supposed to have us drink poison and believe in a life after death?”. The voice said: “Well, You are two separate things: matter and information. Your matter, as you can see, is in quite a bit of trouble. However, if you do it in the correct way, you can separate your matter from your information; your Idea.”. Daniel said: “I sort of can see what you were saying, but I don’t see how this is relevant.”. The character said: “I’m an #Avatar, one of eleven of those. We’re responsible for looking after Information, to try and ensure that no good things get lost to the ages. I came into this world through an information hole that was torn by a scientist. This caused the Event. In a sense, I’m responsible for a lot that happened over the last period of time. However, I couldn’t just allow you all to be moved elsewhere. This is your world, this is where you belong. You shouldn’t just be saved, just because you made things get tough. That’s part of who and what you are. Also, the Information persists after death, through the next generations. People turn into stories, myths, besides obviously also being part of the next generation in Idea. I mean, they get children. Now however, it looks like you all may die, without your information being able to move on. This is grounds for me to be permitted to step in.”. Daniel thought very hard about this. Metaphysics wasn’t really his area of expertise, so he needed some time to process it all. Daniel said: “I would like to think about this first. I think we still have about a month to decide about this, right?”. The Avatar said: “At most, from what I can see. You can think about it, but I wouldn’t take more than a day or two. There is no reason to assume that last night was the last attack on you. Your location is known, and it’s known that you have things worth stealing. So, your enemies will keep coming.”. Daniel asked: “What would happen if we said yes?”. “You would have to go to a certain location, and, at a specific moment, have your Information disconnect from your Energy.”. Daniel clarified: “So, you want us to go somewhere and commit suicide?”. “Bluntly put, basically, yes.”, the Avatar replied. He waited for a moment, and continued: “I get that this is quite a lot to go through all of a sudden. You probably want to think about it, and also about how you want to convey this message to your friends, if you decide to go through with this.”. Daniel said: “I would want them to know the entire story, so they can decide on it themselves. I also want to only do it if everyone agrees; I think we should stay together until the end.”. The Avatar looked a him, somehow looking as though he was quite proud of Daniel. He said: “That would be a very honorable thing to do. It might not result in the best possible outcome, but it does sound fair, in some way at least.”. Daniel thought about it for a moment and said: “I get that it might result in us all being worse off, but this is a risk we’re taking. You may not be telling the truth at all, and then we would have all committed suicide based on a strange voice from a dream. Now, you could cynically say that it would then have just shortened our suffering by a month or two, but still. This is our lives we’re talking about, and just giving it all up. It means giving up on the world.”.

            <Title>The Event</Title>
            <Text>The world is made of information and Energy (Matter, and other energy). Normally, physics dictates that in a closed system (ie. The Universe), there is no Energy lost, and also, no Information is lost. No energy nor information can be added either. 

With the Experiment, that lead to the Event, information entered our world. It was Information outside the normal scope of reality. After some time, it took a more worldly form, behaving soft-of as a person. However, this person-being is just a manifestation of the information that entered the world. With the addition of this information, the stability of the world is gone. 

At the end of the second book, the energy/physical world is broken beyond reasonable repair. However, there is hope, in leaving the world of matter and energy, and persisting solely in the infosphere. Basically, the concepts of the people would move beyond the limits of the world around them, and start existing outside the realms of energy and matter. </Text>
